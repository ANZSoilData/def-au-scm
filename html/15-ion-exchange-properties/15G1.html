<p class="para">Unbuffered solutions of neutral salts may be used to measure exchangeable cations including the acidic cations, Al<sup>3+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, termed exchange acidity (<a href="#ch15ref05">Black 1965</a>). As the solutions are unbuffered, the extractions are considered to occur at or near the pH of the soil. The test is intended for use only on acidic soils; expect inconsequential values if used on neutral and alkaline soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Exchange acidity values obtained by this method are used to calculate the ECEC of neutral and acidic soils. In addition, the exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> values are also involved in the calculation of the Al&#8211;saturation of the exchange complex of acidic soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In this method, soil is equilibrated with 1 M KCl for 1 h at &#8776;25&#176;C at a soil/solution ratio of 1:10. The filtered extract is analysed for what is assumed to be Al<sup>3+</sup> and exchange acidity (<a href="#ch15ref62">Yuan 1959</a>), with H<sup>+</sup> obtained by difference: i.e. Exch. Acidity &#8211; Al<sup>3+</sup>.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 15.7.</strong> Soil exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> by method 15G1 vs % robust CVs, restricted to soils with median 1:5 soil/water pH values &#8804;5.5 (n=24).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Measurement performance across-laboratories for Method 15G1 is available from interlaboratory proficiency programs of ASPAC from 1997&#8211;2007. How % robust CVs vary continuously with increasing concentrations of exchange acidity across samples with 1:5 soil/water pH values &#8804;5.5 are shown in <a href="#ch15fig7">Figure 15.7</a>. The trend line is highly significant. The data were sourced from laboratories across Australasia that participated in ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs (e.g. <a href="#ch15ref39">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch15ref44">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007)</a>.</p>

<p class="para2">Dilute 1.0 mL 45% NaOH solution to 1 L with CO<sub>2</sub>-free deionised water. Avoid unnecessary contact of this solution with the atmosphere. Standardise against potassium hydrogen phthalate as follows:</p>
<p class="indent-para2">Dissolve 4.0845 g of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, previously dried for 1 h at 110&#176;C) in CO<sub>2</sub>-free deionised water and dilute to 1 L in a volumetric flask to give a 0.02 M solution. Pipette 25 mL of this standard solution into a flask, add 25 mL of water and titrate with the NaOH solution to the endpoint at pH 8.3&#8211;8.6, or as indicated by phenolphthalein.</p>
<p class="indent-para2">For a 25 mL aliquot, molarity of NaOH = [0.02 &#215; 25/titre (mL)]</p>
<p class="indent-para2"><a id="page_337"></a>If required, the molarity may be adjusted to a pre-determined concentration by diluting the NaOH solution according to the formula given in Method 4D1.</p>
