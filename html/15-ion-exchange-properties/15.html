<h2 class="h2a">Ion-exchange properties</h2>
<p class="para">Physical and chemical properties of most soils are influenced by their ion-exchange characteristics, including the amount and balance of individual ions present. Important to soil characterisation are the (normally) divalent exchangeable cations Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>; the monovalent cations Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>; trivalent Al<sup>3+</sup>; and soil cation and anion exchange capacity (CEC and AEC). The last two are measures of a soil&#8217;s ability to retain cations and anions, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soil CEC equates to the product of the specific surface area and surface charge density. Coarse materials such as silica sands and poorly weathered feldspar usually have low CEC (&#60;5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg). In contrast, illite and smectite minerals such as montmorillonite, possess moderate to high specific surface areas and surface charge densities. Thus they have relatively high CECs (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref61">Uehara and Gillman 1981</a>). The clay minerals kaolinite and gibbsite have low to moderate specific surface areas but low densities of surface charge from isomorphous substitution, resulting in negligible CEC from permanent charge surfaces.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Active surface charges also develop due to adsorption of potential-determining ions, particularly H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Where this occurs, the net surface charge (this may be negative, zero, or positive) is determined by the ion that is adsorbed in excess. The colloids involved are termed &#8216;variably charged&#8217; as they are influenced by conditions such as solution pH, ionic strength and the presence or absence of specifically adsorbed ions. Functional groups of OM such as carboxyl and amino, as well as mineral oxides, including sesquioxides [these oxides contain three atoms of oxygen with two atoms (or radicals) of some other substance such as Al] possess variable charge characteristics. These properties of colloids are often found in highly weathered soils, which are common in humid, tropical regions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Effects of the charge characteristics of clays and other colloids may not be readily apparent to the observer (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref55">Theng 1980</a>). Losses of nutrient cations, however, such as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are greatest when soil CECs are &#60;5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref46">Sanchez 1976</a>). In contrast, leaching losses of these nutrient cations are typically low from soils of medium (15&#8211;25 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg) to high (&#62;25 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg) CECs.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Where strong weathering has caused the decomposition of clay minerals, the resultant soil colloids typically become dominated by soil minerals with both positive and negative surface charges. As these soils (including organic colloids) become more acidic, their ECECs decline, while AEC usually increase (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref55">Theng 1980</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref61">Uehara and Gillman 1981</a>). As P sorption increases, net positive surface charge decreases (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref38">Parfitt 1980</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nutrient anions that would normally leach under humid conditions can be immobilised within the profile of soils with significant AEC, at least until adsorption sites are saturated. Nitrate is weakly adsorbed, while SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&#8211;, in that ascending order, are strongly adsorbed (Parfitt 1980). <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref06">Black and Waring (1979)</a> identified the importance of highly weathered sub-soils in these processes, while <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref16">Gillman and Abel (1987)</a> were able to partition soils in the Tully&#8211;Innisfail area of north Queensland into three groups on the basis of their surface charge characteristics. River alluvium had relatively high CEC at soil pH (the current soil pH), including a relatively high portion of permanent negative charge. Nutrient and other cations show resistance to leaching in such soils, even if soil acidification subsequently occurs. Another group, mainly soils formed from granitic and metamorphic rocks, had both low CECs and low AECs, a situation where both nutrient cations and anions are likely to leach. The third group, derived almost entirely from basaltic rock, had low CECs at soil pH, but also relatively high AECs (1.9&#8211;3.5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), particularly at depth. These soil properties favour the leaching of cations and the retention of anions such as nitrate. If allowed to further acidify, the ECEC of these soils would decline while AECs would increase (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref43">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>). <a href="#ch15tab1">Table 15.1</a> provides a general guide to the range of CEC values of clay minerals and organic colloids.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Measurements</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soil ion-exchange properties are usually assessed by replacing or exchanging the ion or ions in question with an index ion of similar electrical charge or sign. For example, cations such as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, lithium (Li<sup>+</sup>), and silver thiourea (AgTU) have been used for extraction of exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, and for estimating CEC. Copper thiourea is reported to be a cheaper yet effective alternative extractant to AgTU for the determination of basic cations in soils (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref32">Little 1989</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Factors that affect the results reported for exchangeable cations and CEC include size of the index cation, its affinity for particular ions and exchange sites, the associated anion, ionic strength, the soil and solution pH, soil/solution ratio, and time of contact between the soil and solution. Many of these can alter surface charge characteristics of variable-charge colloids during the soil extraction process.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The presence of soluble or potentially soluble salts of the basic cations, including common salt (NaCl), gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O), limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and dolomite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>/MgCO<sub>3</sub>), can also lead to errors in estimation of exchangeable bases and ECEC. Some methods physically remove these interfering components, usually by pre-treatment with a solvent such as aqueous ethanol or aqueous glycerol (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref58">Tucker 1985</a>). Alternatively, soluble salts may be measured directly and subtracted from an estimate of soluble plus exchangeable bases. They may be ignored when insignificant quantities are present or when only approximate estimates of soil exchange properties are required for soil fertility assessment.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref52">So <em>et al</em>. (2006)</a>, working with two soils from south-east Queensland and extraction with 0.1 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, concluded that when soil solution ionic strength exceeded 50 mM <a id="page_293"></a>or around 4 dS/m, correction for soluble salts was best done by calculation rather than by prior solvent removal of soil solution cations. This was because prewashing increased measured exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations while simultaneously decreasing the measured exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Methods described herein for extraction of basic exchangeable cations employ ammonium chloride (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 7), ammonium acetate (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7), barium chloride/ammonium chloride (0.1 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl), alcoholic 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 8.5, and AgTU. Most can be expected to extract similar amounts of Ca, Mg, Na and K from non-calcareous and non-saline soils (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref18">Gillman <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>). Smaller amounts of Ca and Mg are extracted, especially from oxide-rich soils, by alcoholic 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 8.5, an extractant formulated for use on calcareous and sodic soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The preferred method for the acidic cations (H<sup>+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup>) required for the calculation of ECEC and Al saturation, employs molar potassium chloride (1 M KCl). Exchange acidity of soil at pH 8.2 is determined by extraction with BaCl<sub>2</sub>/triethanolamine. Soil CEC at pH 8.2 (the sum of the exchangeable basic cations plus BaCl<sub>2</sub>/triethanolamine exchange acidity) is a component of a criterion in Soil Taxonomy for separating Alfisols and Ultisols. <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref50">Searle and Lee (1984)</a> reported that AgTU was as effective as 1 M KCl at removing Al from a New Zealand soil.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch15tab2">Table 15.2</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter, which includes and adds to the methods described by Rayment and Higginson (1992). Four chemical procedures for direct estimates of soil CEC are included. Further information on each method category is provided under a series of sub-headings. Refer to <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref23">Hislop and Hornbeck (2002)</a> for guidance on coping with high-salt concentrations in extract solutions during analysis by ICPAES.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Sampling and Sample Preparation</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soil samples for ion exchange determinations, in common with most other soil chemical tests, are typically air dried (40&#8211;45&#176;C max.), ground or sieved to a particle size of &#60;2 mm, prior to analysis and subsequent storage. Unlike some soil fertility tests, however, sampling often involves a sequence of depths throughout the soil profile.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Based on a review by <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref12">Etchevers (1986)</a>, there is evidence that air drying can increase soil surface acidity slightly, due to the polarisation of residual water by cations adsorbed to clay surfaces. This enhanced acidity can, in turn, increase the solubility of organic material to a limited extent. Small increases in extractable Al (assumed to be Al<sup>3+</sup>) have been reported, but this effect is usually ignored because of the analytical convenience of air drying.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The apparent levels of soil K may also be affected by soil drying, sometimes liberating more K and other times fixing soil K (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref12">Etchevers 1986</a>). In addition, the season of the year can affect the amount of Al (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref24">Hun 1971</a>) and K (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref04">Bieske 1968</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref01">Anon 1983</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref12">Etchevers 1986</a>) extracted by laboratory tests. <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref04">Bieske (1968)</a> reported the changes in Queensland soils used for sugar cane involved a fairly regular rise and fall in available K<sup>+</sup> throughout the year. Increases occurred from winter through to the hot, early summer, followed by a subsequent decrease with the advent of summer rains, irrespective of whether the land was cropped or fallowed. Such effects can be minimised by specifying a preferred time for soil sampling, which for sugar cane in coastal Queensland is May to October (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref04">Bieske 1968</a>).</p>
