<p class="para">This method is identical to 15E1 except that a calculation, based on the amount of soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> present, is used to adjust for the apparent level of exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> present in the soil. This approximate correction for soluble Na<sup>+</sup> is an alternative to chemical pre-treatment when EC (1:5, soil/water) exceeds 0.3 dS/m and NaCl is the dominant soluble salt.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Proceed as described in Method 15E1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Calculation and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Convert mg Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>/kg (from Method 5A1 or 5A2) to cmol<sub>c</sub>Cl/kg by dividing by 354.5. On the assumption that all soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> is associated with Na<sup>+</sup>, calculate the corrected value as follows:</p>

<p class="indent-para">Report exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg) as determined from Method 15E1, and exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> as corrected above (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg). Express results on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to convert to an oven-dry concentration. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report CEC<sub>B</sub> and AEC as described for Method 15E1.</p>
