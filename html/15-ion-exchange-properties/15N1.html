<p class="para">High levels of soil Na<sup>+</sup> can adversely affect plant growth and lead to the development of poor soil physical conditions (e.g. <a href="#ch15ref51">Shaw <em>et al.</em> 1987)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A measure of soil sodicity, or the amount of exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> on the soil&#8217;s cation exchange complex, can be expressed numerically in terms of its exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> percentage (ESP). This is defined as 100 times exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> (method is optional) in proportion to the soil&#8217;s CEC (extension of same method used for exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup>), expressed as cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg on an oven-dry basis. The estimate will suffer positive errors if water-soluble Na<sup>+</sup> is included in the value used for exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch15ref37">Northcote and Skene (1972)</a> have categorised ESP in terms of soil sodicity as follows:</p>
<p class="indent-para">ESP &#60;6 non-sodic</p>
<p class="indent-para">ESP 6&#8211;15 sodic</p>
<p class="indent-para">ESP &#62;15 strongly sodic</p>
