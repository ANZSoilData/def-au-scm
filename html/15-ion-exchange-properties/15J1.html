<p class="para">Effective CEC is the sum of the exchangeable bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>; method is optional) plus exchange acidity (Al<sup>3+</sup> plus H<sup>+</sup>; from 1 M KCl &#8211; Method 15G1), all expressed as cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg on an oven-dry basis (e.g. <a href="#ch15ref03">Baker 1984</a>). Other definitions for ECEC are also used (e.g. <a href="#ch15ref11">Coleman and Thomas 1967</a>, <a href="#ch15ref27">Kamprath 1970</a>, <a href="#ch15ref07">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method is relatively simple to perform and usually provides a reliable guide to the actual CEC of neutral and acidic soils, even when these are dominated by variable-charge colloids; however, positive errors from soluble bases &#8211; including those introduced as fertilisers and amendments &#8211; can occur, if these are included in the estimate of exchangeable bases selected for use.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0348-03.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">Report ECEC (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), expressed on an oven-dry basis, noting the code for the method used for exchangeable bases.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Note</em></strong></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;All components in this calculation should be expressed in the same units (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg) and on the same soil moisture status. It is suggested that the air-dry to oven-dry moisture correction be made in advance. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to soil moisture calculations.</p>
