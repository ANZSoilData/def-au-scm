<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter15sec22"></a>15I3 Cation exchange capacity measurement &#8211; automated determination of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup></h3>
<p class="para">This method represents the final step in the analysis of soil CEC by Methods 15B1, 15B2, 15B3 and 15C1. Ammonium ions displaced from exchange sites, together with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> derived from any NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solution residual in the extract, are measured simultaneously.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ammonium is determined by an automated colorimetric procedure based principally on the methods of <a href="#ch15ref21">Henzell <em>et al.</em> (1968)</a> and <a href="#ch15ref34">McLeod and Zarcinas (1976)</a>. The method employs the ammonium-phenate-hypochlorite reaction reviewed by <a href="#ch15ref14">Gehrke <em>et al.</em> (1968)</a> and <a href="#ch15ref48">Searle (1984)</a>. In laboratories ill-equipped to handle phenol, the analytical finish for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> used in Method 15I2 can be substituted. Chloride is determined colorimetrically, based on the reaction of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> with ferric nitrate and mercuric thiocyanate (<a href="#ch15ref34">McLeod and Zarcinas 1976)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Method 7A2a, <a href="#ch15ref20">Gordon <em>et al.</em> (1993)</a> and Section 4120 of <a href="#ch15ref02">APHA (2005)</a> provide more details on SFA. One of the SFA technologies herein outlined is an example based on AutoAnalyzer I technology (<a href="#ch15fig8">Figure 15.8</a>); the second utilises micro-bore technology (<a href="#ch15fig9">Figure 15.9</a>). It is recognised, however, that improvements in system performance are ongoing, and incorporate a better understanding of the way in which dispersion, tubing diameter and flow rate are interrelated (<a href="#ch15ref20">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993)</a>. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer of their SFA equipment. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagrams provided for this method.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Always avoid contact with fumes of NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> in order to minimise analytical errors. Air used during continuous flow analysis of NH<sub>4</sub>-N and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> should be passed through dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and AgNO<sub>3</sub> solutions, respectively, to prevent possible contamination, particularly if room air quality cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ensure individual components of the CEC manifold for NH<sub>4</sub>-N and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> are connected as detailed in <a href="#ch15fig8">Figure 15.8</a> or <a href="chapter15.html#ch15tab9">Figure 15.9</a> (or as recommended by the manufacturer) and that Working Standards and soil CEC extracts are at room temperature before analysis. Prior to commencement of each batch, circulate reagents and Ca-KNO<sub>3</sub>-HNO<sub>3</sub> wash solution for at least 20 min to &#8216;condition&#8217; the system. Check instrument settings by pumping the highest working standard required for several minutes.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine concentration of NH<sub>4</sub>-N and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in the soil extracts directly from regression equations or calibration curves derived from Working Standards (<a href="#ch15tab17">Table 15.17</a>) run on commencement, after about every 30 CEC extracts, and on completion. A reagent blank should also be measured and adjustments made as necessary.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_345"></a>When shutting down the system, immediately transfer the pump tubes from the Ca-KNO<sub>3</sub>-HNO<sub>3</sub> wash solution and the alkaline hypochlorite solution over to water wash. When these lines have been flushed of reagents, transfer all other pump tubes to water wash and continue pumping for at least 10 min.</p>

<p class="para">As the soils are leached with 60% Aqueous Ethanol to remove most residual NH<sub>4</sub>Cl before NH<sub>4</sub> ions are displaced, no correction for any free NH<sub>3</sub> in the entrained NH<sub>4</sub>Cl Extracting Solution is required.</p>
