<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter15sec13"></a><strong>15E2 Exchangeable bases, CEC and AEC by compulsive exchange, pre-treatment for soluble salts</strong></h3>
<p class="para">This method is similar to 15E1 except there is a pre-treatment with aqueous ethanol and aqueous glycerol. Pre-treatment is desirable when an accurate estimate of exchangeable bases is required when soil EC (1:5, soil/water; Method 3A1) exceeds about 0.3 dS/m. Note that aqueous glycerol, at the soil/solution ratio and extraction time of this method, can remove around 0.6&#8211;0.7% of finely divided gypsum from soil. If gypsum is not fully removed, it will subsequently dissolve in the 0.1 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl Extracting Solution, causing positive errors for exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The estimate of compulsive CEC (CEC<sub>B</sub>) is unaffected by the presence of gypsum.</p>

<p class="para"><em>60% Aqueous Ethanol (w/w)</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 15A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>20% Aqueous Glycerol</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 15A2.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Transfer 2.00 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a suitable tared centrifuge tube (30&#8211;50 mL) and add 25 mL 60% Aqueous Ethanol. Seal and shake for 30 min. Centrifuge, remove the supernatant solution by suction and drain the tube on a piece of absorbent paper to remove excess solvent. Disperse the soil mechanically and add a second 25 mL of Aqueous Ethanol. Centrifuge, decant and drain as before.</p>

<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_330"></a>Repeat the process a third time using 20% Aqueous Glycerol. Weigh the centrifuge tube to determine the approximate volume of entrained solvents, then proceed as described in 15E1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Calculation and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Report exchangeable bases (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), expressed on an oven-dry basis, after adjusting for entrained liquid from the pre-treatment to remove soluble salts (as in Method 15A2). Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to convert to an oven-dry concentration. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">If positive errors for exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> due to gypsum are expected, determine the &#8216;true&#8217; value from the following equations, all in the same units:</p>
