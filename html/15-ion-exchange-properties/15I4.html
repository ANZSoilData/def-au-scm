<p class="para">When segmented flow or distillation equipment is unavailable, a titration finish can be used for the estimation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, when determining CEC by Methods 15B1, 15B2, 15B3 and 15C1 in particular. Procedures are based on the formol titration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and the Ag/AgCl reaction for Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (<a href="#ch15ref60">Tucker and Beatty 1974b</a>). Modifications to the formol titration for CEC by NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7 (Methods 15D1 and 15D2) are given in Note 3.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Formol Reagent</em></p>
<p class="para">Mix 500 mL deionised water with 500 mL of filtered (if necessary) 35% formalin &#8211; commercial formaldehyde (CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in water-methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) mixture &#8211; and adjust to pH 8.2 with NaOH. Store in the dark in a stoppered bottle; periodically check and adjust pH, which may fall on long storage.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Aqueous Acetone</em></p>
<p class="para">Mix one part of acetone (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O; commercial) with two parts deionised water. The acetone is employed to sharpen the pH inflection corresponding to the end point of the formol titration. Consequently, it should not contain any free acid.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sodium Hydroxide Solution (NaOH)</em></p>
<p class="para">Concentration may be varied to suit equipment and the nature of samples. For an auto-titrator with a 2.5 mL burette, a strength around 0.05 M NaOH is suitable. For a 10 mL manual burette, preferred strength is about 0.025 M NaOH. A concentration up to 0.2 M NaOH may be required for a micro-burette. Prepare from 45% NaOH solution and standardise (Method 4D1).</p>
<p class="para1">Silver Nitrate Solution (AgNO<sub>3</sub>)</p>
<p class="para">Concentration required will vary with equipment and nature of samples. For an auto-titrator with 2.5 mL burette, use 0.1 M AgNO<sub>3</sub>, prepared by dissolving 16.99 g AgNO<sub>3</sub> and diluting to 1 L with deionised water. For a 10 mL manual burette, use 0.02 M AgNO<sub>3</sub>, prepared by dissolving 3.40 g AgNO<sub>3</sub> and diluting to 1 L with deionised water. Standardise against standard NH<sub>4</sub>Cl &#8211; see procedure for Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (this method).</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_346"></a><em>0.1 M Ammonium Chloride Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 1.4 g NH<sub>4</sub>-N and 3.545 g Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> &#8801; 100 mmol<sub>c</sub> of both NH<sub>4</sub>-N and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 5.3491 g pure, dry ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) and make to 1 L in a volumetric flask with boiled (CO<sub>2</sub> free) deionised water. Confirm NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentration by Method 7A1 or 7A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>0.02 M Ammonium Chloride Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 20 mmol<sub>c</sub> of both NH<sub>4</sub>-N and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute 100 mL 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl standard with CO<sub>2</sub>-free deionised water and make to 500 mL in a volumetric flask.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Calcium-Potassium Nitrate-Nitric Acid Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare as for Method 15I3.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Chloride Titration Medium</em></p>
<p class="para">Sprinkle 0.3 g sodium carboxymethylcellulose (7.0&#8211;7.5% Na) over the surface of 30 mL of deionised water and gently boil to dissolve. Add this solution to 1.0 L deionised water, mix and add 0.5 mL HNO<sub>3</sub>. The function of this reagent, particularly the carboxymethylcellulose, is to improve the indicating electrode response time by keeping the AgCl precipitate as a colloid. (Polyvinyl alcohol can also be used). Add one crystal of thymol to prevent mould growth.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure for Chloride</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Prepare apparatus as described for Method 5A1 except that (unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer) a mixture of one part of Ca-KNO<sub>3</sub>-HNO<sub>3</sub> solution and two parts of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Titration Medium should be substituted for saturated KNO<sub>3</sub> in the outer compartment of the double-junction calomel reference electrode (Note 1).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next standardise the AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (usually 0.1 M or 0.02 M) against 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl standard. (If exactly 0.1 M AgNO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mL is equivalent to 3.545 mg of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>.) Dilute with 10 mL Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Titration Medium and, if required, add deionised water.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0346-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">Make appropriate adjustments if NH<sub>4</sub>Cl differs from 0.1 M.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentration in leachates held for CEC determination by taking a suitable aliquot (5 to 10 mL). Dilute with 10 mL of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Titration Medium (plus deionised water if required) and titrate with AgNO<sub>3</sub> (standardised). End point corresponds to approximately 267 mV. Subsequent titrations with unknowns should be terminated at the end-point voltage, and the volume of AgNO<sub>3</sub> recorded (mL). A blank determination of the Ca-KNO<sub>3</sub>-HNO<sub>3</sub> solution plus Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Titration Medium should also be made with each batch.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Calculation of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Content</em></strong></h3>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0346-02.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">where A = titre of AgNO<sub>3</sub> for sample; and B = titre of AgNO<sub>3</sub> for blank.</p>
<p class="indent-para1a">Make appropriate adjustments to this calculation should molarity of AgNO<sub>3</sub> vary from 0.1 M. For example, if 0.02 M AgNO<sub>3</sub>, the factor is 80 instead of 400.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_347"></a><strong><em>Procedure for Ammonium</em> (Formol Titration; Notes 2, 3 and 4)</strong></p>
<p class="para">Transfer an accurate aliquot of leachate (5 to 10 mL) into a titration vessel and, while stirring, add 8 mL Formol Reagent and 50 mL Aqueous Acetone. Insert pH electrodes and temperature compensator and note pH when steady; the pH should be more acidic than pH 5. Titrate with standardised NaOH (in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub> &#8211; flow N<sub>2</sub> if available) to pH 5.0. Note burette reading (V<sub>1</sub>; mL) then continue titrating to pH 8.2 (V<sub>2</sub>; mL). Record volume of standard NaOH (V<sub>2</sub> &#8211; V<sub>1</sub>; mL) used.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Run a method blank in a similar way, using an identical aliquot of Ca-KNO<sub>3</sub>-HNO<sub>3</sub> leaching solution and note volume (mL) of standard NaOH for titration between pH 5.0 and 8.2 (V<sub>3</sub>; mL). This method blank may have a small positive value. Upon completion of this titration, add a known volume (5&#8211;10 mL) of 0.02 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to the titrated liquid and re-titrate to confirm the standardisation of the NaOH titrant and the optimum end point.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0347-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">where</p>
<p class="indent-para">V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>3</sub> are as earlier defined.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Make appropriate adjustments to this calculation should molarity of NaOH vary from 0.05 M.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>CEC Calculation and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">The CEC corresponds to the difference between the NH<sub>4</sub>-N and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations in the same sample, both expressed as cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg; i.e.</p>
<p class="center-para">CEC[cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg] = NH<sub>4</sub>-N Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup></p>
<p class="indent-para">Should for any reason the soil/final CEC leachate ratio not be 1:40, this must be factored into the before-mentioned calculations.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report CEC (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), expressed on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to convert to an oven-dry concentration. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Notes</em></strong></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;A double junction electrode prevents leakage of the KCl electrolyte from the inner compartment into the titration medium. The secondary salt bridge will eventually be contaminated by KCl and its intended function as a secondary salt-bridge corrupted. Avoid by frequent replacement of electrolyte in the outer compartment of the double-junction electrode. Alternatively, use a mercury/mercurous sulfate electrode as indicated in Method 5A1.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;To ensure the formol titration is quantitative, a large excess of formaldehyde is required. Moreover, to avoid any possibility of solution alkalinity caused by reaction of the displacing solution with soil, the Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + KNO<sub>3</sub> solution is collected into dilute HNO<sub>3</sub>. The titre between pH 5.0 and 8.2 corresponds to the total NH<sub>4</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>, when corrected by the blank titre of an aliquot of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> &#8211; KNO<sub>3</sub> &#8211; HNO<sub>3</sub> solution.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para"><a id="page_348"></a>3.&#160;&#160;If using the formol titration for CEC by ammonium acetate at pH 7, precautions against alkalinity of the NaCl solution should be taken. Usually 1 to 2 mL of 0.01 M acid addition should reduce pH of the aliquot to &#60;5.0. Otherwise proceed in a similar way to that described for Methods 15B1, 15B2, 15B3 and 15C1 except that the reagent blank is 1 M NaCl and CEC calculation is as follows:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0348-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="hangindent-para">4&#160;&#160;Free NH<sub>3</sub> is present in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solutions used for displacing exchangeable cations. It is highest in Method 15C1 where the NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub> ratio approximates to 1:8. In such cases the true NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentration can be calculated by:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0348-02.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="parab">For Methods 15B1, 15B2 and 15B3, and for most soils analysed by Method 15C1, this correction is unnecessary as it is less than the error of the determination. It may be warranted for precise studies involving Method 15C1 on soils that retain large volumes of Extracting Solution, such as strongly swelling clays and highly organic soils.</p>
