<p class="para">This method is similar to 15B1 except that there is a pre-treatment with aqueous ethanol and aqueous glycerol to remove soluble salts.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>60% Aqueous Ethanol (w/w)</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 15A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>20% Aqueous Glycerol</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 15A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Other Reagents</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 15A1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Follow the 60% Aqueous Ethanol &#8211; 20% Aqueous Glycerol wash procedure given for Method 15A2. When completed, transfer the pretreated soil plus about 4 g Acid-washed Sand to the plastic extraction container. Proceed as described in Method 15B1 but make allowance for entrained aqueous solvent as described in Method 15A2.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Determinations and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Determine and report exchangeable cations and CEC (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), expressed on an oven-dry soil basis as for Method 15B1. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
