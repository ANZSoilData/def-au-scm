<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter15sec26"></a><strong>15L1 Base saturation percentage (BSP)</strong></h3>
<p class="para">Base saturation percentage is calculated from the sum of exchangeable bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup> + Mg<sup>2+</sup> + Na<sup>+</sup> + K<sup>+</sup>; method is optional) and soil CEC (method is optional), each of these expressed as cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg on an oven-dry basis. Accordingly, base saturation is the portion of soil CEC accounted for by exchangeable bases.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Base saturation is commonly used as an indicator of soil fertility but does not reflect imbalances in relative proportions of individual exchangeable bases. Generally, BSP values of &#60;20, 20&#8211;60, and &#62;60 are rated as low, medium and high, respectively (<a href="#ch15ref29">Landon 1984</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">In addition to that mentioned in Method 15K1, BSP values are used as indicators of fertility status in the <a href="#ch15ref13">FAO-UNESCO (1974)</a> soil classification.</p>
