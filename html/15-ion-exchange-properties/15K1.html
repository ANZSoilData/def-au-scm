<p class="para">A base-saturated soil in equilibrium with excess CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and with a CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure equal to that of the atmosphere has a pH around 8.2. Soil CEC also reaches a point of relative constancy at this pH (<a href="#ch15ref35">Mehlich 1942</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_349"></a>This estimate of CECpH8.2 is not measured; it is calculated from the sum of exchangeable bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>; method is optional) plus exchange acidity by triethanolamine (Method 15H1), all expressed as cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg on an oven-dry basis. As with ECEC by 15J1, it is prone to positive errors if soluble bases are included in the estimate/measurement of exchangeable bases. Base saturation of CEC at pH 8.2 is used as one of the criteria in Soil Taxonomy (<a href="#ch15ref53">Soil Survey Staff 1975</a>) for separating Alfisols and Ultisols.</p>
