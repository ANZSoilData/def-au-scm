<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter15sec20"></a>15I1 Cation exchange capacity measurement &#8211; distillation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup></h3>
<p class="para">This method is one alternative for the direct measurement of CEC. The described procedure follows removal of exchangeable bases by 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7 and subsequent replacement of exchanged NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> with 1 M NaCl (Methods 15D1 and 15D2). In addition, it is suitable for methods in which exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> are displaced with a mixed KNO<sub>3</sub>-Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution (Methods 15B1 and 15C1), provided corrections are made for excess NH<sub>4</sub>Cl remaining in the soil after removal of exchangeable bases, and for a different ratio of soil/final solution.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>60% Sodium Hydroxide</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 7A1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>2% Boric Acid Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 7A1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Bromocresol Green-Methyl Red Mixed Indicator</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 7A1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>0.010 M Hydrochloric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 7A1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sand/Reagent Blank Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">This should be identical to the displacement solution used on the samples being analysed.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">In Method 15D1 and 15D2 the exchange complex of the soil was saturated with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, then extracted by 1 M NaCl. The NaCl extracts were retained for determination of CEC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Transfer a 20 mL aliquot of the 1 M NaCl leachate to a suitable NH<sub>3</sub> distillation apparatus. Add 5 mL of 60% NaOH and distil the NH<sub>3</sub> into 10 mL of 2% H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> as described in Method <a id="page_340"></a>7A1. Titrate with 0.01 M HCl using Bromocresol Green-Methyl Red Indicator. Analyse the sand/reagent blank solution concurrently with the samples.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Calculation and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">For 0.01 M HCl, a 5.0 g sample and a 20 mL aliquot from the 250 mL collected:</p>
<p class="center-para">CEC (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg = {[Sample titre &#8211; blank titre(mL)] &#215; 2.5</p>
<p class="indent-para">Make an appropriate adjustment if HCl is not 0.010 M.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report CEC (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), expressed on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to convert to an oven-dry concentration. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
