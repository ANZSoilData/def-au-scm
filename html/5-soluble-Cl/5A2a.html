<p class="para">This method, coded as 5A2 in <a href="#ch05ref18">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, involves SFA, a system broadly described elsewhere (e.g. <a href="#ch05ref09">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>; Section 4120 of <a href="#ch05ref05">APHA 2005</a>). The SFA systems herein outlined are examples based on AutoAnalyzer I/II technology and microbore technology. It is recognised that improvements in system performance are ongoing, including faster rates of analysis, lower reagent volumes, more reliability, automatic data handling, sample dilution and speedier reagent change-over. Reductions in dispersion have centred on smaller internal diameters of reaction tubing, down from 2.4 mm in the Technicon AutoAnalyzer I, to 2 mm in the AutoAnalyzer II, and to 1 mm in more modern instruments (<a href="#ch05ref11">Jodo <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The latest systems incorporate a better understanding of the way in which dispersion, tubing diameter and flow rate are interrelated (<a href="#ch05ref09">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>). Continuous flow instrumentation uses a peristaltic pump to draw sample extracts from the sampler into a manifold designed to mix the samples with reagents that are being continuously pumped at predetermined flow rates, and on eventually to the colorimeter detector. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Basis of the colorimetric reaction used is the formation &#8211; in the presence of ferric ions and free thiocyanate ions &#8211; of highly coloured ferric thiocyanate in proportion to Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations. Source of the thiocyanate ions is mercuric thiocyanate; thiocyanate ions are liberated when soluble mercuric chloride forms. Although I<sup>&#8211;</sup> and Br<sup>&#8211;</sup> are also measured along with Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (TA Beech, <a href="http://pers.comm">pers.comm</a>.), it is normally assumed for natural soils that this automated ferricyanide method has no interferences of significance (<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>).</p>

<p class="para">Prepare 1:5 soil/water suspensions as described in Method 3A1. Filter or centrifuge a suitable aliquot for automated SFA.
