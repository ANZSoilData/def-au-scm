<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter05sec04"></a>5A3a Chloride &#8211; 1:5 soil/water extract, ion chromatography (chemical suppression of eluent conductivity)</h3>
<p class="para">Ion chromatography permits quantitative determination of common anions (F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, Br<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>) in known aqueous matrices within the mg/L concentration range or lower. The technology can effectively distinguish the halides (F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Br<sup>&#8211;</sup>) and eliminates the need to use hazardous reagents during analysis (<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>). The technique is not commonly recommended for F<sup>&#8211;</sup> in unknown matrices for reasons including possible interference from simple organic acids (formic, carbonic, etc.) that elute close to F<sup>&#8211;</sup>. There are &#8216;work-arounds&#8217; using special columns with dilute eluent or gradient elution with NaOH. Ion <a id="page_57"></a>chromatography analyses can be completed sequentially within 30 min or less using a few mL of extract. Alternative IC technology with electronic suppression of eluent conductivity and conductivity detection is also available (see Method 5A3b). Analysts should note that Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> (if present) elute close together and therefore are potential interferences for each other (<a href="#ch05ref06">ASTM 2000</a>). Also, if a particular anion is present at a high concentration, it may interfere by causing a very large peak on the chromatogram, causing other peaks to be masked. Such interferences are often avoided by dilution and/or via the use of specialised columns.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determination of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentration, in conjunction with the other anions mentioned, involves injecting a finely filtered aliquot (&#8804;0.45 &#956;m, with &#60;0.20 &#956;m membrane filter preferred) of the 1:5 soil/water extract into an IC appropriately configured. In the system described, based on <a href="#ch05ref14">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> (1984)</a>, the sample is pumped through three different ion exchange columns and then into a conductivity detector.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The first column (pre-column) acts as a guard, protecting the second or separator column from fouling by particulates including OM. The separator column typically contains a styrene divinylbenzene-based anion exchange resin of low capacity, designed to separate anions based on their affinity for exchange sites on the resin. The third is a suppressor column packed with a high-capacity cation exchanger capable of converting the eluent and separated anions to their corresponding acids. Finally, the separated anions, in their acid form, are determined quantitatively by their respective retention times, following detection with an EC cell and comparison with known standards (<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">This chemically-suppressed, IC system has United States Environmental Protection Agency approval for the analysis of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> in drinking water. The method is also suited to surface waters, and mixed domestic and industrial wastewaters (<a href="#ch05ref14">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> 1984</a>). The approximate detection limit is 0.1 mg Cl/L, which equates to 0.5 mg Cl/kg of air-dry soil. Refer to Australian Standard AS 3741 (<a href="#ch05ref02">Anon 1990</a>), Section 4110 C of <a href="#ch05ref04">APHA (1998)</a> and Method D 4327&#8211;97 of <a href="#ch05ref06">ASTM (2000)</a> for further details on analysis by IC.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 5.5.</strong> Schematic of a chemically suppressed Ion Chromatographic System.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Set up the IC in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Specifications typically change over time. Equilibrate by pumping Eluent Solution (usually around 2 mL/min) for &#8776;15&#8211;20 min through all three columns. Allow sufficient time for the system to stabilise, or until a stable baseline is obtained. Adjust the conductivity detector during this period (usually 10&#8211;30 &#956;S). Also zero-out eluent conductivity with the detector offset, and with the fiber or membrane suppressor, adjust the regeneration flow rate, usually to 2.5&#8211;3 mL/min.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine the retention time for each anion by injecting a 2.0 to 3.0 mL aliquot of the Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Solution for Retention Time (4.0 mg Cl/L). Use a syringe and inject into the sample entry port. If other anions are to be determined, their retention times should also be calibrated at this stage, with solutions containing only the anion of interest. Note the time required for the peak for each anion to appear on the chromatogram and record in minutes. These times will vary from one column to another, and are influenced by eluent flow rates and temperature. With the Eluent Solution described, the order of anions is always F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub>2<sup>&#8211;</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>. Retention times vary with instrument settings and solution concentrations. An example is around 1, 3, 4.5, 9, 11 and 21 min, respectively. Bromine, if included, would appear between the NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> peaks.</p>

<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_60"></a>Analyse the Reagent Water blank and the High-, Intermediate- and Low-range Calibration Solutions by injecting 2&#8211;3 mL aliquots as previously described. Prepare calibration curves for Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (and all other anions of interest) by plotting peak height (usually &#956;S) or peak area &#8211; from the chromatogram &#8211; against the concentrations of the anion calibration solutions. Note that a single standard calibration is possible if linearity can be established for a known detector setting. In such cases, determine the calibration factor <em>F</em> from peak height or area and the retention time. A calibration curve is preferred, however, for better precision and bias when the relationship is non-linear such as with HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>(<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next, inject a known volume of the filtered soil/water extract (same volume as used for the calibration solution/s). Record the ion chromatogram, evaluate peak height or peak area as required for comparison with the relevant calibration curve, and determine the anion concentration (Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in this case), initially as mg anion/L. Multiply by 5 to convert to mg anion species/kg air-dry soil. [Another sample can be injected after the last peak (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>) has appeared and the conductivity signal has returned to base line.] To avoid interference when Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> or other anions present at high concentrations overlap neighbouring species, minimise this by sample dilution with reagent water, and adjust for the dilution used.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When the calibration is known to be linear, the following equation can be used to calculate the anion concentration as follows:</p>
<p class="center-para">5 mg anion/kg air dry soil = [<em>H</em> &#215; <em>F</em> &#215; <em>D</em> &#215; <em>5</em>]</p>
<p class="para2a">where <em>H</em> = peak height or area;</p>
<p class="para2"><em>F</em> = response factor or concentration of standard/height (or area) of standard;</p>
