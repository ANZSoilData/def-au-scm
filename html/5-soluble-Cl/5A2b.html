<p class="para">Flow injection analysis systems typically operate at high sensitivity. The technology involves introducing, under the force of a peristaltic pump, a precisely measured volume of liquid sample from the sampler into a continuously flowing carrier stream. An injection valve with a <a id="page_55"></a>fixed-volume sample loop or an injection valve with a fixed time period determines the injected volume of sample. A carrier stream sweeps the sample out of the loop and into the manifold where it disperses. The concentration gradient formed is detected continuously by (in this case) a colour reaction that occurs in the presence of continuously flowing reaction solutions (see Section 4130 of <a href="#ch05ref05">APHA 2005</a> for further details of the technology).</p>

<p class="indent-para">The colorimetric chemical reaction involved is identical to that of Method 5A2a; i.e. Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> reacts with mercuric thiocyanate to produce mercuric chloride, liberating thiocyanate ions. In the presence of ferric salts, these thiocyanate ions produce a characteristic orange-like colour, the intensity of which is proportional to the Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentration. In common with Method 5A2a, Br<sup>&#8211;</sup>, I<sup>&#8211;</sup>, cyanide, thiosulfate and nitrite will interfere positively if present, which is unlikely in most natural (uncontaminated) soils. Expect Methods 5A2a and Method 5A2b to yield virtually identical results.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para">Use reagents and standard solutions from Method 5A2a for guidance, or as advised by the manufacturer. All reagents should be free of particulates. Alternatively, vacuum filter before use through a 0.45 &#956;m membrane filter known not to be contaminated by Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Degas reagents before use if necessary.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Prepare 1:5 soil/water suspensions as described in Method 3A1. Filter or centrifuge a suitable aliquot for automated FIA. These should be free of particulates. If necessary, pass the extract through a 0.45 &#956;m membrane filter known not to be contaminated by Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ensure individual components of the FIA&#8211;Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> manifold are assembled in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations, guided by <a href="#ch5fig4">Figure 5.4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">&#8216;Condition&#8217; the system before use by pumping reagents and relevant standard solutions. Make a final check on instrument settings, then determine Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations in soil extracts directly from standard solutions run on commencement and as required throughout the batch of unknown soil extracts. A good, second-order polynomial calibration can be expected. Use deionised water as the wash solution and to dilute soil extracts of high Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations.</p>
