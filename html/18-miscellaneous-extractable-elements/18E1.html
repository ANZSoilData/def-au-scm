<p class="para">See the preamble to Method 18D1 for relevant information on the inorganic and biological chemistry of Cd, including reasons why its measurement in soils has attracted international interest. That preamble also included information on many extractants used to assess the phyto-availability of Cd and other heavy metal pollutants of soils (<a href="#ch18ref11">Beckett 1989</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">This method is similar to that of Method 18D1 but is sufficiently different to prevent the direct interchange of results. Specifically, it uses more dilute calcium chloride (0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> <em>cf.</em> 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>), a longer extraction time (4 h <em>cf.</em> 2 h) and a wider soil/solution ratio (1:5 <em>cf.</em> 1:2.5).</p>
<p class="indent-para">One reason given by <a href="#ch18ref53">Novozamsky <em>et al.</em> (1993)</a> for preferring 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1:10 soil/solution ratio) was that its concentration was &#8216;more or less the same salt concentration as the average soil solution&#8217;. <a href="#ch18ref81">Whitten and Ritchie (1991)</a> also used 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> but at a soil/solution ratio of 1:5. <a href="#ch18ref48">Milham <em>et al.</em> (2004)</a> have modelled the effects of soil properties on the concentration of Cd extracted by 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> from soils of the Sydney Basin, while <a href="#ch18ref41">Loganathan and Hedley (1997)</a> used soil extraction with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> to study the downward movement of Cd and P from phosphatic fertilisers in a New Zealand pasture.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This method was used by <a href="#ch18ref10">Barry <em>et al.</em> (2006)</a> to monitor the phyto-bioavailability of Cd from land-applied bio-solids and metal salts in several Queensland cropping systems. Preferred instrumental analysis of clarified extracts involves ICP-MS or GFAAS. See <a href="#ch18ref33">Fraser <em>et al.</em> (1986)</a>, if the laboratory has access to atom-trapping AAS, which has high sensitivity and is relatively free from Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> matrix interferences. The PQL of this method (30 times the standard deviation of analyte concentration in 10 blank solutions) = 0.001 mg Cd/kg, while recovery of Cd added to clarified soil extracts spiked with 0.5 &#956;g Cd/L approximates 100% (A Jeffrey, <a href="http://pers.comm">pers.comm</a>.).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 1.47 g calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) and make to 1.0 L with high-purity double deionised water (DDW). Store in a clean (Cd-free), covered plastic container.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>2% Nitric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 18D1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Cadmium Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 50 mg of Cd.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute a certified multi-element standard containing Cd (and often other metals) or dissolve 0.1141 g high grade cadmium sulfate (3CdSO<sub>4</sub>.8H<sub>2</sub>O) and make volume to 1.0 L with <a id="page_396"></a>DDW and 2% Nitric Acid in the proportion 1+4 in an acid-cleaned and rinsed borosilicate volumetric flask. Store in a clean polypropylene reagent bottle.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Cadmium Secondary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 1.0 mg of Cd.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute 10.0 mL Cd Primary Standard, while swirling/stirring, to 500 mL with 0.01 M CaC1<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution&#8211;2% Nitric Acid in the proportion 1+4. The borosilicate volumetric flasks should be acid-cleaned and rinsed before use. This solution is best prepared each time working standards are required but may be stored for up to 2 months.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Cadmium Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Accurately add, for example, 0.08, 0.6, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 30.0, 60.0 and 100.0 mL of Cd Secondary Standard to separate 200 mL volumetric flasks and make to volume with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution&#8211;2% Nitric Acid in the proportion 1+4. The borosilicate volumetric flasks should be acid-cleaned and rinsed before use. These working standards contain Cd concentrations of 0.0004, 0.003, 0.010, 0.020, 0.040, 0.080, 0.15, 0.30 and 0.50 mg Cd/L. For a 1:5 soil/extract ratio these correspond to soil concentrations of 0.002, 0.015, 0.050, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, 0.75, 1.5 and 2.5 mg Cd/kg. Store in clean polypropylene reagent bottles and use within one month.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">As for Method 18D1, ensure sieves, other apparatus, glassware and filter papers used for soil preparation, soil extractions, filtration and instrumental analysis contain no measurable Cd contamination. Employ acid washing and other preparative steps outlined in Method 18D1; see Notes 1 and 2 of Method 18D1 for more details.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dry soil samples in a clean, dust-free environment, ideally in a Class 1000 Clean Room or within a Class 100 Laminar Flow Hood. When air-dry (40&#8211;45&#176;C max), crush/mill the soil to &#60;2 mm and store in sealed, uncontaminated containers. A stainless steel mill is suitable, provided no Cd is introduced.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Subsequently, weigh 5.0 &#177; 0.01 g of air-dry soil into clean, dry 50 mL centrifuge tube or similar, then add 25.0 mL 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution to each, stopper, then mechanically shake end-over-end for 4.0 h at around 22&#8211;25&#176;C. After shaking, allow solutions to stand for &#8776;15 min. Centrifuge in 10 mL centrifuge tubes (subsequently remove any floating material by vacuum tube) or filter (e.g. Whatman No. 542) prior to instrumental analysis by ICP-MS (preferred) or GFAAS. Only use ICPAES if elevated concentrations are expected. Follow manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations with respect to instrument parameters. A reagent blank should also be measured and adjustments made as necessary. Also, dilute any over-range samples with 0.01 M CaC1<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For determination of Cd by ICP-MS, initially check for instrument response/performance, using the 10 &#956;g/L Mix v Tuning Solution. All instrument performance criteria should be <a id="page_397"></a>confirmed at this point. Next dilute 2 mL of each clarified soil extract solution with 8 mL of 2% HNO<sub>3</sub> into a 10 mL polyethylene centrifuge tube. Cap and shake and make allowance for this dilution when calculating results. Mix the Tellurium Internal Standard (this is to compensate for drift and matrix effects) with each standard and diluted sample extract in the proportion 0.42 mL/min of Te Internal Standard to 0.6 mL/min of diluted sample extract during operation of the ICP-MS. Also, check a reference solution every 10 samples and recalibrate if drift exceeds 10%. If analyte concentration exceeds the standard calibration range, dilute the clarified soil extracts with calibration blank and repeat relevant determinations. The optimum batch size (samples, including checks) is &#8776;48&#8211;50.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For ICPAES, noting that this technology lacks sensitivity at low Cd concentrations, the preferred wave length is either 226.5 nm or 361.05 nm, with no interference to Cd from Fe and Al expected. For GFAAS, the preferred wave length is 228.8 nm. Also for a Perkin Elmer<sup>TM</sup> 4100ZL GFAAS, use a sample volume of 20 &#956;L (normal) or 10 &#956;L or 5 &#956;L (if calibration limit is exceeded) together with a Matrix Modifier (1.2% w/v ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate) volume of 5 &#956;L.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine Cd concentrations of sample extracts directly or from a graph (or from a regression equation), taking account of any dilutions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report 0.01 M CaC1<sub>2</sub>-extractable Cd as mg Cd/kg on an air-dry soil basis.</p>
