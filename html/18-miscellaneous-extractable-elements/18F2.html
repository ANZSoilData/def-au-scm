<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter18sec08"></a>18F2 Mehlich 3 Extractable P &#8211; colour finish</h3>
<p class="para">Method 18F1 provides most details on the use of Mehlich 3 as an extractant for P (Mehlich 3&#8211;P) and other elements. This method provides an alternative analytical finish for P for those laboratories without access to ICPAES instrumentation, or who need to rely on diagnostic criteria developed colorimetrically.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The molybdophosphic blue color procedure of <a href="#ch18ref51">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>, as modified by <a href="#ch18ref80">Watanabe and Olsen (1965)</a> and as outlined by <a href="#ch18ref06">Anon (2000)</a>, is the preferred colorimetric <a id="page_403"></a>analytical finish for Mehlich 3&#8211;P. Based on median results from North American Proficiency Testing and from other studies, expect results by the <a href="#ch18ref51">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> analytical finish to be from zero to &#62;20% lower than corresponding values obtained from the ICPAES analytical finish. Soil concentrations equivalent to 1&#8211;400 kg P/ha can usually be measured without dilution with Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution. Notes 1, 2 and 3 of Method 18F1 are equally relevant to this method.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution (0.2 M CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + 0.25 M NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> + 0.015 M NH<sub>4</sub>F + 0.013 M HNO<sub>3</sub> + 0.001 M EDTA)</p>
<p class="para">Prepare and store as per Method 18F1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sulfuric-Molybdate-Tartrate Solution A</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 50.0 g AR grade ammonium molybdate [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O] in 250 mL water (distilled water preferred if deionised water contains soluble organic compounds). Dissolve 1.2125 g potassium antimony tartrate [K(SbO)C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.&#189;H<sub>2</sub>O] in the aqueous molybdate solution. Slowly add 700 mL 18 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and mix well. Let the mixture cool, then dilute to 1.0 L with water. Store the solution in a polyethylene or Pyrex bottle in a dark, cool (&#8776;4&#176;C) compartment.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Ascorbic Acid Solution B</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 88.0 g <em>l</em>-ascorbic acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in water and dilute to 1.0 L with deionised water. Prepare fresh daily (downsized <em>pro rata</em> to the volume required) or alternatively store solution in a dark glass bottle in a refrigerated (&#8776;4&#176;C) compartment.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sulfuric-Molybdate-Tartrate-Ascorbate Working Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dilute 10 mL Ascorbic Acid Solution B plus 20 mL of the Sulfuric-Molybdate-Tartrate Solution A with Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution to a volume of 1.0 L. This solution should be at room temperature before use. Prepare fresh daily.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Primary Standard &#8211; Mehlich 3</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 200 mg of P.</p>
<p class="para6">Prepare and store as per Method 18F1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Working Standards &#8211; Mehlich 3</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare and store as per Method 18F1, covering a range at least equivalent to 0&#8211;200 mg P/kg.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh, extract soils and prepare clarified soil extracts as for Method 18F1. Next, accurately transfer 1.0 mL of each unknown sample extract (free of soil) to a small flask. Also prepare a suitable selection of P Working Standards &#8211; Mehlich 3 in the same manner, including the same volume of (final) Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution as a reagent blank. To each of these add 27 mL of Sulfuric-Molybdate-Tartrate-Ascorbate Working Solution using a pipette or dilutor-dispenser. Allow &#8776;20&#8211;25 min for the colour reaction to stabilise, then read and record the transmission/absorbance at 880 nm (2 cm light path probe spectrophotometer) or 882 nm for the standard cuvette-type spectrophotometer within &#60;6 h after addition of the Sulfuric-Molybdate-Tartrate-Ascorbate Working Solution. These steps may be automated, <a id="page_404"></a>taking care to maintain identical ratios of sample solution and reagents and the same sequence of additions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare a calibration curve of absorbance against concentration of standards (or use a regression equation). For samples analysed without any additional dilutions, soil levels can be read directly from the calibration curve in units of mg P/kg. Read concentrations of samples and reagent blanks from the graph. If the soil extract requires dilution with Final Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution, multiply measured results by the appropriate dilution factor.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report Mehlich 3&#8211;P (mg P/kg, w/v air-dry) (required for proficiency testing across Australasia). If used to calculate M3PSR<sub>colourP</sub>, indicate this derives from Method 9K1a.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Only if particularly requested, report Mehlich 3&#8211;P (mg P/dm<sup>3</sup>) on an air-dry basis or multiply by 2 to obtain an estimate of mg P/ha for a 20 cm soil depth (see Note 3 of Method 18F1).</p>
