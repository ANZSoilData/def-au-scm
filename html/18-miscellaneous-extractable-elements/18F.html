<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter18sec06"></a>18F Mehlich 3 multi-element tests</h3>
<p class="para">This multi-element test (<a href="#ch18ref46">Mehlich 1984</a>) covers extractable P, the basic exchangeable cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>), extractable S, selected trace elements (Cu, Mn, Zn, B), extractable Fe and extractable Al. Environmental soil P tests (<a href="#ch18ref13">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>) that can be derived from components obtained from Mehlich 3, specifically Mehlich 3&#8211;P saturation ratios, are documented in <a href="chapter09.html#chapter09">Chapter 9</a> as Method 9K1a [Mehlich 3&#8211;P Saturation Ratio (M3PSR<sub>colourP</sub>)] and as Method 9K1b [Mehlich 3&#8211;P Saturation Ratio (M3PSR<sub>ICPAES</sub>)].</p>
<p class="indent-para">The main function of the extractant&#8217;s components are (<a href="#ch18ref07">Anon 2007</a>): CH<sub>3</sub>COOH &#8211; buffers the extracting solution to pH 2.5 when all reagents are added and mixed, thus preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from being precipitated as calcium fluoride; NH<sub><em>4</em></sub>NO<sub><em>3</em></sub> &#8211; facilitates extraction of the exchangeable cations Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, since it reacts with the CH<sub>3</sub>COOH to form ammonium acetate; HNO<sub><em>3</em></sub> &#8211; extracts a portion of calcium phosphates, while its H<sup>+</sup> component aids the extraction of basic and micronutrient cations; NH<sub><em>4</em></sub>F &#8211; the F<sup>&#8211;</sup> component helps to extract Fe and Al phosphates, while NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> complements NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> in extracting basic cations; and EDTA &#8211; chelates micronutrients (particularly Cu) and prevents precipitation of calcium fluoride.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Mehlich 3 extractant has applicability for diagnostic purposes across a wide assortment of soils ranging in reaction from acidic to basic (<a href="#ch18ref37">Jones Jr. 1990</a>). It is used widely in North America and increasingly in other countries, including the Czech Republic (<a href="#ch18ref85">Zb&#237;ral and N<img src="../images/ebreve.jpg" alt="Image"></img>mec 2000</a>) and Australia (<a href="#ch18ref15">Bolland <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#ch18ref62">Rayment 2004</a>). <a href="#ch18ref65">Rayment <em>et al.</em> (2009)</a> have summarised the analytical performance of Australasian soil testing laboratories relative to North American laboratories for a suite of Mehlich 3 soil tests on four soils from North America.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In practice, the Mehlich 3 test utilises a 1:10 v/v soil-solution ratio or a 1:10 w/v ratio, inclusive of vigorous shaking for 5 min at 200 &#215; 4 cm reciprocations/min (or equivalent), followed by measurement of a range of elements in the subsequent soil-free extract. It is a rapid, empirical method that offers low soil testing costs by replacing at least three &#8216;traditional&#8217; soil tests.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Across Australasia, method comparisons and field calibration studies with Mehlich 3 mostly involve a 1:10 w/v soil-solution ratio, as in this procedure. This reflects local practice for many empirical soil tests. One reason is that the particle size distribution of a <a id="page_398"></a>wide selection of dry, ground (or crushed) Australian soils of &#60;2 mm can vary considerably, contributing to variability in weights of equal volumes of sub-samples. The US Department of Agriculture (<a href="#ch18ref17">Burt 2004</a>) and Canadians&#8217; <a href="#ch18ref71">Sen Tran and Simard (1993)</a> also specify a w/v soil/solution ratio of 1:10. Approximate results for a v/v soil/solution ratio can be calculated using a weight-volume conversion calculation for each sample.</p>
