<p class="para">This method for &#8216;Nitric K&#8217; has been used in the sugar industry of Queensland for several decades (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref22">Chapman (1971)</a>). It is based on the extraction of soil K<sup>+</sup> by boiling with 1.0 M nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) for 30 min at an initial soil/solution ratio of 1:40 (<a href="#ch18ref35">Haysom 1971</a>). The difference between this measure of fixed K<sup>+</sup> and exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> equates to non-exchangeable available K<sup>+</sup> (<a href="#ch18ref22">Chapman 1971</a>; <a href="#ch18ref42">Martin and Sparks 1985</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Diagnostically, the test estimates easily mineralisable K<sup>+</sup> available for crop growth. The values are influenced by soil type and texture and by the addition of sugar-mill by-products such as mill mud and boiler ash. Mean values (units of cmol<sub>c</sub>K/kg) in surface soils (0&#8211;250 mm) monitored by BSES Ltd and reported by <a href="#ch18ref23">Chapman <em>et al.</em> (1981)</a> reveal region to region variability as follows: Mossman&#8211;Cairns = 2.1; Babinda&#8211;Tully = 2.1; Ingham = 1.7; Burdekin = 2.8; Mackay = 1.3; Bundaberg = 0.9; and Maryborough&#8211;Rocky Point = 0.8. Nil or little crop response by Queensland sugar cane to applied K fertiliser is expected when the root zone exceeds 0.6 cmol<sub>c</sub>K/kg by this test (<a href="#ch18ref05">Anon 1998</a>). As soil extracts are further diluted 1+1 prior to analysis, the final soil/solution ratio is 1:80.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 2.5 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL conical flask, graduated at 200 mL. Also bring a suitable laboratory hotplate to operating temperature using a previously checked setting so as to achieve gentle refluxing at 100&#176;C. Add 100 mL of 1.0 M HNO<sub>3</sub> Extracting Solution to each conical flask, add two clean glass beads to each flask, and place these on the pre-heated hot plate without delay. Insert a small, clean glass funnel in the neck of each flask, then allow these flasks to reflux gently for 30 min. (Temperature of the extract solution should be maintained as close as possible to 100&#176;C during this period.)</p>
<p class="indent-para">After 30 min of gentle reflux, remove the flasks from the hotplate, then, with minimum delay, rinse and remove the funnels. Encourage rapid cooling to &#8776;23&#8211;25&#176;C by running tap (or cooling) water for 1&#8211;2 min or by partly submerging the conical flasks in a cold water bath for a similar time. (Ensure no coolant water contaminantes the contents of the flasks, which should all receive the same attention.)</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute the contents of each of the now cooled conical flasks accurately to 200 mL with deionised water and mix well. Next decant a portion of each extract into a suitable centrifuge tube, then centrifuge to clarify the soil extracts prior to instrumental analysis. (It is important to follow boiling and cooling times carefully and to ensure soil extraction conditions are adhered to.)</p>
<p class="indent-para">Analyse for K<sup>+</sup> in the clarified aliquots and K Working Standards by ICPAES, by AAS, or by FES, using procedures similar to those described in Method 15A1 or 18A1. Wavelengths for K by ICPAES or AAS = 766.5 nm. Use Working Standards as appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report nitric acid-extractable K<sup>+</sup> (mg K<sup>+</sup>/kg) on an air-dry basis. To convert to cmol<sub>c</sub>K<sup>+</sup>/kg, divide mg K<sup>+</sup>/kg by 391.</p>
