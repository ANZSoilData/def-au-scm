<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec01"></a>7A1 Total soil-N, semi micro Kjeldahl &#8211; steam distillation</h3>
<p class="para">This semi-micro Kjeldahl method is based on use of 100 mL digestion flasks (heat resistant). Alternatively, digestion tubes (e.g. 50 mL) and a drilled Al block on a hotplate can be used for the digestion step, with appropriate adjustments to weights and volumes of soil and reagents.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sodium hydroxide is then added to release NH<sub>3</sub> by steam distillation. The NH<sub>3</sub> is subsequently absorbed in dilute boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>), with TSN determined by titration with standard acid.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Apparatus</em></h3>
<p class="para">See <a href="#ch7fig3">Figure 7.3</a> for an example of a &#8216;conventional&#8217; steam distillation apparatus, similar to that described by <a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner (1996)</a>. This apparatus, constructed from borosilicate glass, may require modification to suit 100 mL digestion flasks or smaller Kjeldahl digestion tubes.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Digest Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">Commercial grade sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; 18 M).</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Catalyst Mixture</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare an intimate mixture of 1.0 kg anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and 100 g of anhydrous copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>) after first grinding each component separately. Alternatively use Kjeldahl catalyst tablets containing 1.0 g Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 0.1 g CuSO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p class="para1"><em>60% Sodium Hydroxide Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 600 g commercial or technical grade sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in deionised water, cool and make to 1.0 L.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>2% Boric Acid Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 80.0 g boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>) in about 3 L of water, heating if necessary. Add water to make 4 L of solution. Adjust pH to 5.0 with dilute NaOH immediately prior to use. If &#8804;5000 &#956;g of N needs to be fixed, 1% H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution (10.0 g H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>/L) can be substituted to increase the sharpness of the end point.</p>

<p class="para">Mix 5 parts 0.1% bromocresol green (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>14</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S) dissolved in 95% ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) with 1 part 0.1% methyl red (C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in 95% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH. Proportions may need to vary slightly to obtain the neutral-grey transition colour of the indicator. <em>Those who suffer from colour blindness may need to use an alternative indicator with more obvious colour-change characteristics.</em></p>

<p class="indent-para">Note that 0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> may substitute for 0.010 M HCl and is preferred for <sup>15</sup>N analyses. Also, alternatives to Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O can be substituted for standardisation purposes.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Digest and distil a reagent blank (see Note 1) with each batch of assays, using distillation apparatus similar to that shown in <a href="#ch7fig3">Figure 7.3</a>. Weigh 1.00 g of finely-ground (&#60;0.5 mm), air dry soil into a 100 mL Kjeldahl digestion flask (see Note 2). Add 2.0 mL deionised water and, after swirling for a few minutes, allow to stand for 30 min. Add 2.2 g catalyst mixture (or two catalyst tablets) and 6.5 mL of digest acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). Heat flasks cautiously in a fume cupboard or with an attached fume extractor until water is lost and frothing has ceased. Increase heat so that H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> condenses about one-third way up the neck of the digestion flasks. Continue boiling for 2 h after the soil has become bleached. On completion of digestion, cool, then add slowly and with swirling, about 30 mL deionised water to prevent solidification of the digest solution on complete cooling. There is no requirement to dilute to a known volume.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare the distillation apparatus (<a href="#ch7fig3">Figure 7.3</a>; see Note 3) by adding 10.0 mL of 2% H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> to each 100 mL borosilicate beaker or flask. Place the beaker under the condenser outlet so the end of the condenser is just below the surface of the H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> solution. Carefully add &#8776;25&#8211;30 mL 60% NaOH Solution to each digestion flask and quickly attach the flask to the distillation unit; the solution should be distinctly alkaline, commonly indicated by the formation of a brown precipitate of ferric hydroxide &#8211; (Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>). Distil for 5 min at a distillation rate of &#8776;8 mL/min until at least 30 mL are collected. Lower the beaker so the condenser tip is above the solution and rinse the end of the condenser with deionised water. Remove flasks and stop distillation. Temperature of the distillate should not exceed 40&#176;C to prevent loss of N as NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add 5&#8211;6 drops of the mixed indicator and titrate the distillate with standardised 0.01 M HCl. The end-point is indicated by a colour change from pale green to faint pink.</p>
<p class="indent-para">If preferred, the end point of the titration with 0.01 M HCl can be determined potentio-metrically to pH 5.0, although the ionic strength of individual solutions can affect this pH slightly.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="para">For 1 g of air-dry soil sample and 0.01 M HCl on the total digest.</p>
<p class="center-para">%TSN [(sampletitre &#8211; blank titre) &#215; 0.014]</p>
<p class="indent-para">Make appropriate adjustments for differences in sample weight and concentration of acid.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report TSN (%N) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Notes</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;To ensure the digest blanks are as realistic as possible with respect to C content (and to help detect any NO<sub>3</sub> &#8211; contamination that might otherwise go undetected in the blank), add a small quantity of sucrose, to approximately reflect the soil&#8217;s TOC concentration. Information on the C content of sucrose is provided in <a href="chapter06.html#chapter06">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para"><a id="page_103"></a>2.&#160;&#160;For convenience during subsequent steam distillation, use a standard length 100 mL semi-micro Kjeldahl digestion flask fitted with a ground glass socket and two glass hooks.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">3.&#160;&#160;See <a href="#ch07ref16">Bremner and Mulvaney (1982)</a> and <a href="#ch07ref61">Saffigna and Waring (1977)</a> for details on appropriate glass and stainless steel steam distillation apparatus.</p>
