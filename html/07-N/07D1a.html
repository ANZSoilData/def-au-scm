<p class="para">Pioneers of hot KCl extraction to obtain a useful laboratory index of PMN include <a href="#ch07ref51">&#216;ien and Selmer-Olsen (1980</a>), <a href="#ch07ref25">Gianello and Bremner (1986a)</a> and <a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> (1996)</a>. The method is attractive analytically, as many laboratories are already set up to measure NH<sub>4</sub>-N in KCl extracts of air-dry soils.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>2 M KCl Extracting Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 7C1. Ensure any stored solution is well stoppered to prevent NH<sub>3</sub> absorption from the environment.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Other Reagents</em></p>
<p class="para">As for 7C2a &#8211; NH<sub>4</sub>-N only.</p>
<p class="para"><a id="page_135"></a>PMN<sub><em>KCl</em></sub><em>(Ammonium) Standard Solutions</em></p>
<p class="parab">PMN<sub>KCl</sub> (Ammonium) Primary Standard</p>
<p class="parab">1 mL contains 0.20 mg of NH<sub>4</sub>-N.</p>
<p class="indent-parab">Prepare as for 7C2a.</p>
<p class="paraz">PMN<sub>KCl</sub> (Ammonium) Secondary Standard</p>
<p class="parab">1 mL contains 0.05 mg of NH<sub>4</sub>-N.</p>
<p class="indent-parab">Pipette 125 mL of NH<sub>4</sub> Primary Standard into a 500 mL volumetric flask and make to volume with 2 M KCl extracting solution. Freshly prepare when working standards are required.</p>
<p class="paraz">PMN<sub>KCl</sub> (Ammonium) Working Standards</p>
<p class="parab">Pipette 0, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 32.0, 40.0 and 60.0 mL of PMN<sub>KCl</sub> (NH<sub>4</sub>) Secondary Standard into separate 200 mL volumetric flasks. Make to volume with 2 M KCl extracting solution. These solutions contain 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 &#8230; 15.0 mg N/L as NH<sub>4</sub>, equivalent to soil concentrations of 0, 6.7, 13.3, 20.0, 33.3, 50, 66.7, 100, 133.4, 166.7 and 250 mg/kg PMN<sub>KCl</sub> -N for a soil/solution ratio of 1:16.67.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Extraction</em></p>
<p class="para">Weigh 3.0 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 75 mL stoppered digest tubes suitable for use in a precise, temperature-controlled Al digestion block. These digest tubes should be prior calibrated to 50 mL. Add 25 mL of 2 M KCl Extracting Solution and quickly heat at 95&#176;C for 16 h. Cool the extracts to room temperature (&#8776;25&#176;C) as soon as possible then dilute with 2 M KCl Extracting Solution at the same temperature to 50 mL. After dilution, shake each digest tube manually for 15 sec, then filter through a Whatman No. 42 paper in an NH<sub>3</sub>-free environment. The final soil/solution ratio is 1:16.67.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Analysis</em></p>
<p class="para">Set up the automated colour, SFA equipment (only for NH<sub>4</sub>-N) as described for Method 7C2a and as recommended by the manufacturer of the equipment, noting the 1:16.67 final soil/solution ratio. &#8216;Condition&#8217; the manifold before use, make a final check on instrument settings, then determine NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations in the PMN<sub>KCl</sub> extracts from relevant working standards run on commencement and as required throughout the batch. Dilute the PMN<sub>KCl</sub> extracts with 2 M KCl extracting solution (same batch) if N concentrations exceed the top standard. Also use 2 M KCl or deionised water as the wash solution during autoanalysis.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Calculation and Reporting of PMN<sub><em>KCl</em></sub></h3>
<p class="para">PMN<sub>KCl</sub> = (Measured PMN<sub>KCl</sub> &#8211; Mineral N from Method 7C2a/b, (or equivalent), with all results expressed as mg N/kg, air-dry.</p>
