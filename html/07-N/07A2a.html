<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec02"></a>7A2a Total soil-N, semi micro Kjeldahl &#8211; automated colour, continuous segmented flow</h3>
<p class="para">Segmented, continuous flow analysis technology is broadly described elsewhere (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref28">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>; Section 4120 of <a href="#ch07ref06">APHA 2005</a>). The SFA herein outlined is an example based on AutoAnalyzer I/II technology. It is recognised, however, that improvements in system performance are ongoing, including faster rates of analysis, lower reagent volumes, more reliability, automatic data handling, sample dilution and speedier reagent change-over. Reductions in dispersion have centred on smaller internal diameters of reaction tubing, down from 2.4 mm in the Technicon AutoAnalyzer I, to 2 mm in the AutoAnalyzer II, and to 1 mm in more modern instruments (<a href="#ch07ref30">Jodo <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>). The latest systems incorporate a better understanding of the way in which dispersion, tubing diameter and flow rate are interrelated (<a href="#ch07ref28">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">To accommodate the automated colorimetric finish, the Kjeldahl digest described in Method 7A1 is diluted to a known volume. The NH<sub>4</sub>-N and any free amino acids in diluted digest solutions are measured colorimetrically at 660 nm by the nitroprusside/dichloro-S-triazine modification (<a href="#ch07ref62">Searle 1975</a>; <a href="#ch07ref12">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) of the Berthelot indophenol reaction reviewed by <a href="#ch07ref63">Searle (1984)</a>. Free amino groups that can react are most likely to be present in soils that have been fumigated or dried at elevated temperatures (<a href="#ch07ref18">Burton <em>et al.</em> 1989</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The continuous flow instrumentation uses a peristaltic pump to draw sample extracts from the sampler into a manifold designed to mix the samples with reagents that are being pumped at predetermined flow rates, and on eventually to the colorimeter detector. It is acknowledged that the analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1.00 g of ground (&#60;0.5 mm) air-dry soil into a 100 mL Kjeldahl digestion flask, graduated at 150 mL. Add 2.0 mL deionised water, swirl and stand for 30 min then add 2.2 g catalyst mixture (or two catalyst tablets) and 6.5 mL H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (see Note 1). Digest as described in Method 7A1. Cool, dilute to 150 mL with deionised water and shake well. After any solids have settled, or if necessary after centrifugation, take an aliquot for autoanalysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Set up autoanalysis equipment as shown in flow diagram (<a href="#ch7fig4">Figure 7.4</a>), noting that instrument selections and settings should be in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. &#8216;Condition&#8217; the manifold before use, make a final check on instrument settings, degas reagents if necessary, then determine N concentrations in soil digest solutions directly from relevant working standards run on commencement and as required throughout the batch of unknowns. If necessary, dilute digests containing &#62;24 mg N/L with digest blank solution or redigest using a reduced sample size. Also use digest blank as the wash solution during auto analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report TSN (%N) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Some soils can consume sufficient H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> during Kjeldahl digestion to cause errors in the subsequent colorimetric determination of N (<a href="#ch07ref12">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>). No adjustment to the volume of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> should be necessary with this method, however, at common soil N concentrations, as the boundary condition of 15% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> consumed should not be reached, even when soils are highly calcareous.</p>
