<h2 class="h2a">Nitrogen</h2>
<p class="para">Nitrogen (N) is present in all living matter and is a major constituent of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere, where it is enriched relative to the earth&#8217;s crust 3:1 by weight. It occurs in intrusive and igneous rocks, largely as &#8216;fixed&#8217; ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), with an average content in igneous rocks of 37 mg N/kg (<a href="#ch07ref69">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). <a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner (1996)</a> reported that the total soil N (TSN) content of soils ranges from &#60;0.02% in subsoils to &#62;2.5% in peats, while the plough layer of cultivated soils often contains between 0.02&#8211;0.5% N, with a global mean of 0.2% N (<a href="#ch07ref13">Bowen 1979</a>; <a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner 1996</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Most soil N is associated with organic compounds including proteinaceous forms from plant, animal and microbiological residues. These and all other forms of soil N can undergo chemical and biological transformations under appropriate conditions. Important inorganic combined forms of soil N involved in these reactions include nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>&#8211;) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>) (<a href="#ch07ref69">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). The latter three ionic forms constitute the &#8216;mineral N&#8217; component of TSN.</p>
<p class="indent-para">From a land-use and soil fertility viewpoint, the TSN and &#8216;mineral N&#8217; components are of particular interest. Nitrate and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> are important sources of N for plant growth, while TSN provides a measure of the quantity of N that can be &#8216;mineralised&#8217; by micro-organisms. In addition, use of the Haber-Bosch process during the past century of synthetically transforming atmospheric N to NH<sub>3</sub> has accelerated the amounts and forms of N added to soils as synthetic fertilisers. Urea, NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> are the main forms of N in commercial mineral fertilisers.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch07ref46">Metson (1961)</a>, <a href="#ch07ref12">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1987</a>), <a href="#ch07ref17">Bruce and Rayment (1982)</a> and <a href="#ch07ref05">Anon (2001)</a> have independently provided ratings for TSN relevant to New Zealand and Australia (<a href="#ch7tab1">Table 7.1</a>). It is postulated that the low organic N status of many Australian soils is related to their naturally low P and S status (<a href="#ch07ref37">Ladd and Russell 1983</a>). These authors also report that for six major soil groups from South Australia, TSN concentrations ranged from 0.04&#8211;0.22% N by weight (average of 0.12% N), of which about 3.2% (geometric mean) was biomass N. Australia&#8217;s National Land and Water Resources Audit (<a href="#ch07ref05">Anon 2001</a>) reported that the lowest levels of TSN (&#60;0.1% N) are usually associated with rangelands, with highest levels (&#62;0.2% N) found in forest and cultivated soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The surface horizons of 11 New Zealand reference soils compiled by <a href="#ch07ref71">Vortman (1980</a>) ranged from 0.09&#8211;0.87% N (Kjeldahl method; median 0.33% N), with median concentrations at around 50 and 100 cm in the same soils of 0.06 and 0.02% N, respectively. The modelled distribution of TSN by weight in topsoils for different Australian land uses have been tabulated by <a href="#ch07ref05">Anon (2001)</a>. Ants and termites also play a role in the soil N cycle (<a href="#ch07ref38">Lobry de Bruyn and Conacher 1990</a>).</p>

<p class="indent-para1">While TSN measurements are essential in mass-balance studies and also provide a general indication of the quality of soil OM, they are rarely a good predictor of the responsiveness of crops to N fertiliser applications (<a href="#ch07ref67">Strong and Mason 1998</a>). Those authors reported that NO<sub>3</sub>-N was commonly a more useful predictor of fertiliser-N requirements, particularly for crops such as cotton, maize, oats, sorghum and wheat grown under Australian conditions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The reliable measurement of TSN is analytically challenging. This is due partly to the ability of N to transform itself from one chemical species to another (e.g. protein N to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, to NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211; and vice versa) and from gaseous, aqueous, adsorbed and absorbed phases and vice versa. In brief, the N cycle in soil, in which microbes play crucial roles, include fixation, mineralisation, nitrification, leaching, denitrification and plant uptake. These transformations and their reaction rates are influenced by temperature, moisture, soil biological activity, plant species, and soil fertility status, including pH. The fact that transformations can occur during transport of samples to the laboratory, during drying and preparation of samples for analysis, and even during the analytical process (from dust and volatile NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> fumes in particular) adds to the challenge.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is considerable literature on the sampling and subsequent treatment of soils prior to N analysis, which takes account of the N cycle and the variable distribution of N in soils (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref59">Rayment and Pulsford 1974</a>; <a href="#ch07ref23">Etchevers 1986</a>). In common with C, concentrations of soil N vary with depth, with totals almost always highest in the plough layer, followed by an exponential decline with soil depth (<a href="#ch07ref05">Anon 2001</a>). The reverse, however, can apply to NO<sub>3</sub>-N due to leaching of native and fertiliser N, at least to the subsoil&#8217;s long-term wetting front. Accordingly, soil sampling depth is an important pre-laboratory variable.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Excluding in-field extractions immediately after sampling, which <a href="#ch07ref33">Keeney and Nelson (1982)</a> prefer for valid results for inorganic forms of N, soil samples should be kept clean and at &#8804;4&#176;C during transport to the laboratory, where they are usually dried, ground and perhaps sieved and stored before analysis. According to <a href="#ch07ref16">Bremner and Mulvaney (1982)</a>, it is unlikely that air drying will significantly affect subsequent results for inorganic N, when soils contain low percentages (e.g. 1&#8211;3%) of this fraction of TSN, and when drying occurs in the absence of NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> vapours or aerosols. Air drying (temperatures &#8804;40&#8211;45&#176;C) or oven drying (to &#8776;105&#176;C) of soils containing unusually large amounts of inorganic N, however, may lead to significant transformations and/or losses of N. Drying soils at temperatures &#62;45&#176;C for mineral-N analyses is not recommended (unless there are biosecurity concerns; see <a href="#ch07ref56">Rayment 2006</a>), as N-transformations such as an elevation in apparent NH<sub>4</sub>-N status, loss of NO<sub>2</sub>-N, and changes either way in apparent NO<sub>3</sub>-N status can occur (<a href="#ch07ref59">Rayment and Pulsford 1974</a>; <a href="#ch07ref54">Rayment 1993</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_95"></a>Fine grinding to &#60;0.15 mm or &#60;0.5 &#956;m helps to lessen soil heterogeneity, particularly for TSN, when samples weights of &#60;1.0 g are presented for analysis. Thereafter, the dry samples can usually be stored for prolonged periods in closed plastic or glass containers. Several investigators have shown that prolonged storage of air-dry soils in paper containers open to the atmosphere can result in significant increases in exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub>-N (<a href="#ch07ref33">Keeney and Nelson 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch7tab2">Table 7.2</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter for measuring TSN, mineral N fractions, and potentially mineralisable N. Further information on each method category is provided under a series of minor headings.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Total (and Approximate Total) Soil-N</em></h3>
<p class="para">Guided by <a href="#ch07ref57">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, Code 7A defines methods for TSN. These embrace three different measurement technologies; viz. wet oxidation, dry combustion (Dumas N), and IR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The third digit and fourth letter identify method modifications that deal with the presence of significant NO<sub>3</sub>-N and different measurement technologies.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Wet oxidation technology (<a href="#ch07ref34">Kjeldahl 1883</a>), has wide acceptance (<a href="#ch07ref16">Bremner and Mulvaney 1982</a>; <a href="#ch07ref20">Craft <em>et al.</em> 1991</a>). Nitrogen in the sample is converted to NH<sub>4</sub>-N by digestion in the presence of a catalyst, with heating to &#8776;420&#176;C. Distillation/titration or colorimetric determinations of the NH<sub>4</sub>-N present or formed (three methodological options) are used to complete the measurement of TSN, following wet oxidation. Choice of analytical &#8216;finish&#8217; should not significantly affect results, although the technologies are identified by different codes for tracking purposes. <a href="#ch07ref03">Amin and Flowers (2004)</a> have undertaken a contemporary assessment of Kjeldahl methodology.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Unless precautions are taken, Kjeldahl digestion does not ensure quantitative recovery of all forms of soil N, particularly from some heterocyclic compounds and in substances with N-N and N-O bonds (<a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner 1996</a>). Adequate recoveries are usually achieved but when complete recoveries are essential and when soil NO<sub>3</sub>-N is known to exceed around 0.002%, the sodium thiosulfate-salicylic acid modification of the Kjeldahl digestion procedure should be employed (Method 7A3).</p>
<p class="indent-para">There are also questions about the ability of Kjeldahl digestion to fully recover indigenous, clay-fixed NH<sub>4</sub>-N (<a href="#ch07ref66">Stewart and Porter 1963</a>). As Australian soils are generally low in this N fraction (<a href="#ch07ref42">Martin <em>et al.</em> 1970</a>, <a href="#ch07ref11">Black and Waring 1972</a>) any associated analytical errors should be inconsequential.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nowadays, dry, high-temperature combustion systems (Dumas) offer a robust alternative to Kjeldahl digestion for the measurement of TSN. Indeed, a range of manufacturers have developed automated and/or microprocessor controlled instruments, which mostly are able to measure at least total C, N and S in the same sample. For examples of manufacturers, operating principles and typical applications, see Table 1 of <a href="#ch07ref65">Smith and Tabatabai (2004)</a>. The technology is suited to <sup>15</sup>N tracer studies. Dumas N dry oxidation includes all forms of N, without the need for lengthy pretreatments (<a href="#ch07ref07">Bellomonte <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>). Tests on fully automatic equipment should take around 3&#8211;5 min each to perform. Practical quantitation limits depend on the amount of sample used but are typically around 0.01&#8211;0.02% TSN.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Analytically, finely ground soil samples (&#8804;0.5 mm) of known weight are sequentially introduced into an oxidation furnace and subjected to flash combustion from about 900&#8211;1350&#176;C in a stream of O<sub>2</sub>, releasing N<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and other gases. These gases then pass into a reduction furnace containing Cu at about 650&#176;C, which removes excess O<sub>2</sub> and converts NO<sub>x</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>, noting that CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour are absorbed in chemical traps (usually in anhydrone tubes). The N<sub>2</sub> gas is separated from residual imputities and quantified, commonly by thermal conductivity (<a href="#ch07ref43">McGill and Figueiredo 1993</a>). As with soil C and because multiple elements may be analysed concurrently, analytical cleanliness and freedom from detectable impurities are essential, particularly to prevent positive errors at low elemental concentrations. Similarly, soil sampling and grinding equipment should be free of oil/waxes and corrosion inhibitors, as these substances can transfer impurities to the sample (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref22">Dowling <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>), including C that is often measured simultaneously with TSN.</p>

<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_98"></a>In common with other high temperature combustion instrumentation, the analyst must take precautions to prevent burns and fires, and also while handling compressed gases. Certainly avoid open flames and sparks and have a fire blanket and an appropriate fire extinguisher close to hand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">As an alternative to direct measurement, TSN can be &#8216;predicted&#8217; by mathematical relationships established between both NIR and MIR reflectance spectroscopy and conventionally measured TSN concentrations (<a href="#ch07ref29">Janik <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>; <a href="#ch07ref47">Meyer 1998</a>; <a href="#ch07ref41">Malley <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#ch07ref45">Merry and Janik 2001</a>). These non-destructive techniques are coded as 7A6a and 7A6b, respectively. They create no adverse environmental wastes and can have very good precision, but accuracy depends on confirming highly significant correlations between conventionally measured TSN concentrations. Generic calibration datasets require comprehensive local validation prior to routine use.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Other than in research papers dealing with the use of IR reflectance spectroscopy, comparative data on this technology relative to &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods of chemical analysis for TSN has still to emerge. Comparative data for Method 7A2 based on Kjeldahl digestion (not modified to include all NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and by Dumas high-temperature combustion (Method 7A5) are available from ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs. Across 72 finely ground reference soils ranging from around 0.01&#8211;0.58% N, the grand median for Method 7A2 was 0.116% N, compared with 0.120% N for Method 7A5, which approximates to 1:1.007. How robust coefficients of variation can be expected to vary continuously with increasing TSN concentrations by the two methods are shown in <a href="#ch7fig1">Figure 7.1</a>. The data are from laboratories across Australasia that participated in ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007 (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref52">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch07ref58">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Mineral-N</em></h3>
<p class="para">The measurement of NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N in soils must be undertaken with close attention to detail, noting air drying invalidates results for NO<sub>2</sub>-N (<a href="#ch07ref33">Keeney and Nelson 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Water or salt solutions are suitable extractants for NO<sub>3</sub>-N (and NO<sub>2</sub>-N) across the great majority of soils, although water may fail to extract all NO<sub>3</sub>-N held weakly on positively-charged surfaces of variably charged soil colloids. In terms of quanties that can be adsorbed, anion exchange capacities up to 3.5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg have been measured in subsoils of highly weathered soils derived from basalt in the Tully&#8211;Innisfail area of North Queensland (<a href="#ch07ref27">Gillman and Abel 1987</a>). Chloride will readily replace this adsorbed NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211;.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 7.1.</strong> Soil TSN concentrations by two methods vs % robust CVs.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_99"></a>As (potentially) a monovalent exchangeable base, NH<sub>4</sub>-N must be displaced from the surface of negatively charged soil colloids with another cation, commonly K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>. The unionised form (NH<sub>3</sub>) is increasingly likely to be present when soil pH values exceed pH 9.0. Once extracted, NH<sub>4</sub>-N, NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N can be determined conveniently by steam distillation/titration or by automated colorimetric procedures. More details are given in preambles to these methods.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ion chromatography provides an alternative, reliable, yet relatively slow analytical finish for water-soluble NO<sub>3</sub>-N in the mg/kg concentration range, simultaneously with other common soil anions (an analytical positive). The need to inject a finely-filtered aliquot (&#60;0.45 &#956;m with &#60;0.20 &#956;m membrane filter preferred) of the 1:5 soil/water extract into the IC, unless automated, adds to laboratory-operator time and effort. Extracts with elevated EC levels also need to be diluted. See Australian Standard AS 3741 (<a href="#ch07ref04">Anon 1990</a>) and to the preamble to water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Method 5A3a for more details on IC technology, which does avoid the need to use hazardous reagents during analysis (<a href="#ch07ref06">APHA 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Choice of method for components of soil mineral-N is largely an issue of preference and the laboratory&#8217;s level of instrumental sophistication and operator training. Another consideration is analytical performance, albeit little comparative data are available from Australasia. The continuous relationships (see <a href="#ch7fig2">Figure 7.2</a>) for NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations, respectively, and % robust CVs derive from ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007 (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref52">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch07ref58">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ion selective electrodes for both NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N offer an alternative measurement technology. Details are not included, however, as both electrodes can suffer from serious interferences [e.g. K<sup>+</sup> interferes strongly with the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> electrode, while several anions can interfere &#8211; electrode (<a href="#ch07ref48">Mulvaney 1996</a>)]. Several Australian soil testing services in the 1960s&#8211;1970s did use the NO<sub>3</sub>-N ion selective electrode for both diagnostic and research purposes, but confidence in the accuracy of results at the time was low.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Potentially mineralisable-N (PMN)</em></h3>
<p class="para">Estimates of how much soil N will be released as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211; (forms that can be utilised by plant roots) are challenged by the dynamic nature of soil N. Temperature, moisture and soil biology all have an influence in releasing mineral-N from OM. Therefore, it is not surprising many chemical and bio-chemical methods have been developed in efforts to quantify PMN or contributing components (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref14">Bremner, 1965</a>; <a href="#ch07ref01">Adams and Attiwill 1986</a>; <a href="#ch07ref39">Lowe 1993</a>; <a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>; <a href="#ch07ref75">Wang <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch07ref49">Mulvaney <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch07ref35">Kliese <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). No indicies have achieved universial success, yet estimates of PMN can help guide the need for N fertilisers.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 7.2.</strong> Concentrations of soil mineral-N components vs % robust CVs.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_100"></a><em>In situ</em> techniques are often used to estimate expected net N mineralisation (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref53">Raison <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>). Constraints of these and laboratory-based incubation methods include the lengthy time they take, often multiple days under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Chemical methods are more convenient for soil testing services, with rapidity their main attribute.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two laboratory-based methods for PMN are included. The first is a chemical procedure that utilises hot-KC1 extraction, as this has been shown to correlate with biological methods (<a href="#ch07ref25">Gianello and Bremner 1986a</a>,<a href="#ch07ref26">b</a>; <a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>). Extraction conditions, however, are inconsistent with respect to temperature and extraction time, which range from 100&#176;C for 2&#8211;4 h (<a href="#ch07ref25">Gianello and Bremner 1986a</a>; <a href="#ch07ref73">Walley <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#ch07ref08">Benbi and Haer 2007</a>) to 90&#176;C for 16&#8211;20 h (<a href="#ch07ref51">&#216;ien and Selmer-Olsen 1980</a>; <a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>), with 90&#176;C for 16 h preferred for soils containing high concentrations of OM. <a href="#ch07ref44">McTaggart and Smith (1993)</a> showed there was a good correlation between hot KC1-extractable N and N uptake by barley; however <a href="#ch07ref21">Curtin <em>et al.</em> (2006)</a>, working with 30 soils from New Zealand, found hot water-extractable N to be superior to hot 2 M KCl as a chemical predictor of PMN. It is an advantage that the method is not-appreciably affected by air drying or by air-dry storage of soil samples (<a href="#ch07ref25">Gianello and Bremner 1986a</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The second PMN method utilises anaerobic incubation in the laboratory for seven days, based broadly on the methods of <a href="#ch07ref76">Waring and Bremner (1964</a>) and <a href="#ch07ref32">Keeney and Bremner (1966</a>). The method to obtain an index of PMN to plants relies on estimation of the NH<sub>4</sub>-N formed, relative to that originally present, when soil is incubated in water for seven days and subsequently extracted by 2 M KCl. This test uses field-moist soils that need to be handled carefully between sampling and preparation for analysis to minimise ongoing N transformations. The method is unsuitable for use on air-dried soils.</p>
