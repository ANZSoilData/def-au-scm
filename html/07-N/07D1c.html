<p class="para"><a href="#ch07ref60">Russell <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a> reported positively on the potential of NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to predict PMN in soils used for Australian-grown rice. For example, similar wavelengths of NIR soil spectra were correlated with both plant-N uptake and N mineralisation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">NIR reflectance spectroscopy for PMN<sub>KCl</sub> relies on good relationships between absorbances in the NIR spectral region (from overtones and combination bands of fundamental absorbances) and corresponding results obtained by &#8216;conventional&#8217; method 7D1a or 7D1b. Ideally, continuous relationships should be linear, with coefficients of determination &#8805;0.85&#8211;0.9 across the expected soil concentration range.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Stabilise and verify the set-up and operating performance of the NIR spectrometer, usually incorporating an auto-focussing diffuse reflectance accessory or capability. Also confirm the &#8216;standard calibration&#8217; for the &#8216;conventional&#8217; Method 7D1 of preference.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In common with Method 7A6a, load the instrument&#8217;s auto-sampler with samples, previously dried to &#8776;40&#176;C and finely ground (e.g. &#60;0.5 mm) to minimise soil heterogeneity. Typically, the instrument or its associated computer will integrate the spectral signals with the calibration equations to provide the result without further calculation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Calculation and Reporting of PMN<sub>KCl</sub></h3>
<p class="para">Obtain PMN<sub>KCl</sub> by NIR and Mineral N from Method 7C2b (both expressed as mg N/kg air-dry) then calculate as follows:</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_137"></a>Net PMN<sub>KCl</sub> = [NIR Measured PMN<sub>KCl</sub> &#8211; Mineral N from Method 7C2a/b (or equivalent)], with all expressed as mg N/kg, air-dry.</p>
