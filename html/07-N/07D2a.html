<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec29"></a>7D2a Potentially mineralisable N, anaerobic incubation &#8211; automated colour, continuous segmented flow</h3>
<p class="para">Mineralisable soil N resulting from anaerobic incubation is determined under laboratory conditions as the difference between the NH<sub>4</sub>-N measured in two separate soil extracts using 2 M KCl. The first is extracted immediately and the second after a seven-day anaerobic incubation at 40&#176;C with the soil covered by water. The seven-day incubation is carried out in sealed containers that have minimal headspace. After incubation, 2.5 M KCl extracting solution is added (extractant now &#8776;2 M KCl) and mixed prior to analysis. The initial (day zero) extraction is the same as that carried out for mineral-N, based on 2 M KCl extraction (Method 7C2a). It follows that if an estimate of NO<sub>3</sub>-N is also required, it can be obtained, along with NH<sub>4</sub>-N, from the day zero extract.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method described is adapted from <a href="#ch07ref31">Keeney (1982)</a> and B Daly (pers. comm.). It provides an index of net anaerobic potentially mineralisable N (PMN<sub>An</sub>), rather than a measure of true field mineralisation.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Handling/Preparation of Soils</em></p>
<p class="para">After in-field sampling, keep samples cool (&#8804;4&#176;C) and expeditiously transport soils to the laboratory in sealed plastic bages (polyethylene preferred). Room temperature storage in the laboratory for more than a few hours is not advised: if necessary, store at &#8804;4&#176;C for only one to two days at most before commencing in-laboratory sample preparation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sieve field-moist sample through a 2 mm or 4 mm sieve in an NH<sub>3</sub>-free environment, taking care to remove visible roots and macro-fauna.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine the soil-water content of all samples, by oven drying at 105&#176;C for 16&#8211;24 h as for Method 2B1. Typically, weigh accurately &#8776;20 g sub-samples into pre-weighed containers. Use the following equation to express water content as percent of oven-dry (105&#176;C) soil:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0138-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">Use the calculated water content for each sample to determine the weight of moist soil, equivalent to an oven-dry weight of 5.0 g of soil. Use formula:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0138-02.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">Using the results obtained from Equation 2, weigh 2 &#215; 5.0 g oven-dry equivalents from each well mixed, sieved field-moist soil sample. Transfer one of these into a 100 mL Extracting Bottle/Flask for &#8216;immediate extraction&#8217; and the second into a universal bottle for &#8216;seven day incubation&#8217;.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Immediate Extraction</em></p>
<p class="para">Add 50 mL of 2 M KCl Extracting Solution to each 100 mL Extracting Bottle/Flask containing the weighed soil sample. Include two reagent blanks and one laboratory reference sample around every 20&#8211;30 &#8216;samples&#8217;. End-over-end shaking (1 h) is preferred. Filter extracts to &#60;0.20 &#956;m, such as through Advantec Toyo 5C paper. Filtered extracts (capped) may be stored at &#8776;4&#176;C if not scheduled for immediate analysis. These extracts may be stored for longer periods if frozen.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Incubation and Post-incubation</em></p>
<p class="para">To the &#8216;universal bottles&#8217;, each containing 5.0 g (equivalent) of oven-dry soil, add 10 mL deionised water, tightly cap, then stand in an incubator operating at 40 &#177; 0.5&#176;C for seven days.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_139"></a>Following incubation, remove &#8216;universal bottles&#8217; from the incubator and shake each bottle to mix contents, then transfer quantitatively to 100 mL &#8216;extraction bottles&#8217; using 40 mL of 2.5 M KCl solution. Next shake end-over-end for 1 h, then filter and store (if necessary) as for the &#8216;immediate extraction&#8217; samples.</p>
