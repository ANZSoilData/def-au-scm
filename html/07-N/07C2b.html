<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec24"></a>7C2b Mineral-N &#8211; 2 M KCl, automated colour, FIA</h3>
<p class="para">This method is based on the extraction of mineral-N from air-dry soil with 2 M KCl (1:10 soil to solution ratio for 1 h at 25&#176;C), followed by automated FIA colorimetric procedures to determine NH<sub>4</sub>-N and (NO<sub>3</sub>-N + NO<sub>2</sub>-N) on the one combined analytical system: (refer to Note 1 for 7C1 Methods). Technical aspects of FIA technology have been discussed earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent-para">FIA uses a peristaltic pump to draw sample from the sampler into the sample loop of an injection valve. The injection valve is then switched so that the carrier stream sweeps the sample out of the loop and into the manifold, where it mixes with reagents that are being continuously pumped through the system, and on eventually to relevant detectors. The analytical techniques described herein for NH<sub>4</sub>-N and (NO<sub>3</sub>-N + NO<sub>2</sub>-N) are similar to those used by Landcare New Zealand (B Daly, pers. comm.) and by <a href="#ch07ref36">Knepel (2002)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Extraction</em></p>
<p class="para">Extract soils and prepare clarified 2 M KCl extracts as for Method 7C1. Include two reagent blanks and one laboratory reference sample around every 20&#8211;30 samples. End-over-end shaking (1 h) is preferred. Filter extracts to &#60;0.20 &#956;m, such as through Advantec Toyo 5C paper. Filtered extracts may be stored at &#8776;4&#176;C if immediate analysis (preferred) is not possible. They may be stored for longer periods if frozen after filtration.</p>
<p class="para"><a id="page_133"></a><em>FIA Determination</em></p>
<p class="para">Set up the FIA analyser as shown in the flow diagrams (<a href="#ch7fig12">Figures 7&#8211;12</a> and <a href="#ch7fig13">7&#8211;13</a>). Refer to Method 7B1b for guidance on preparation and use of the Cd-Cu reduction column incorporated in the NO<sub>3</sub>-N module. Switch on the computer and load the relevant software. Prepare the sample table and load sampler. Pump water through all reagent lines and check for leaks and smooth flow. Switch to reagents and allow system to equilibrate for a few min. Run samples and standards in sequences as recommended by the manufacturer and determine N concentrations in 2 M KCl extracts from relevant Working Standards run on commencement and as required throughout the batch. Dilute soil extracts with 2 M KCl extracting solution if N concentrations exceed the top standard. Also use 2 M KCl or deionised water as the FIA wash solution.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The result from the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> segment of the manifold represents NO<sub>3</sub>-N + NO<sub>2</sub>-N. When NO<sub>2</sub> is known or assumed to be absent or insignificant, however, report as NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N (mg N/kg).</p>
<p class="indent-para">If conditions given for Method 7C1h apply and NO<sub>2</sub>-N is known to be present, operate the system as earlier described but (in the NO<sub>3</sub> segment of the manifold) operate with an inactive Cd-Cu reducing column.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Use a selection of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> working standards and record NO<sub>2</sub>-N concentrations.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculations</em></h3>
<p class="para">Calculate and report as described in Method 7C2a; i.e. report NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N or NH<sub>4</sub>-N, NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N (all mg N/kg) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
