<p class="para">This non-destructive test for TSN uses MIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The instrument&#8217;s outputs should be related to one of the 7A&#8211;TSN &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods, either using generic relationships from a spectral library or by establishing in-house relationships with coefficients of determination for validation of samples of &#8805;0.9 being achievable.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_114"></a><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Stabilise and verify the set-up and operating performance of the MIR spectrometer, usually incorporating an auto-focussing diffuse reflectance accessory or capability. Also confirm the &#8216;standard calibration&#8217; for the 7A&#8211;TSN method of preference. For example, if there is need to deal with the possible presence of elevated NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations, then the preferred &#8216;conventional&#8217; method would be 7A3 or 7A4.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Load the instrument&#8217;s auto-sampler with &#8216;unknown soils&#8217;, previously dried to &#8776;40&#176;C and finely ground (e.g. &#60;0.5 mm) to lessen sample heterogenerity. Typically, the instrument or its associated computer will integrate the spectral signals with the calibration equation/s to provide the result without further calculation, subject to the moisture status of the conventional method&#8217;s results. If these were expressed on an oven-dry basis, no adjustment for residual moisture in the sample is required. If the calibration equations were based on conventional measurements expressed on an air-dry basis (&#8776;40&#176;C), then the MIR results will need to be adjusted for residual moisture using relevant air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratios.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report TSN (% N) by MIR on an oven-dry basis. Refer, if necessary, to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
