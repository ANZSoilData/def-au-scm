<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec14"></a>7C1 Mineral-N &#8211; 2 M KCl, steam distillation</h3>
<p class="para">The analytical procedures described in this method are similar to those described by <a href="#ch07ref33">Keeney and Nelson (1982)</a>, by <a href="#ch07ref57">Rayment and Higginson (1992</a>) and by <a href="#ch07ref48">Mulvaney (1996)</a>. They follow extraction of mineral-N from soil with 2 M KCl at a 1:10 soil/solution ratio for 1 h. Magnesium oxide is used for the distillation of NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub>-N. Subsequently, finely ground Devarda&#8217;s alloy is employed for the reduction of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N to NH<sub>4</sub>-N, while sulfamic acid is added when necessary to destroy NO<sub>2</sub>-N.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The NH<sub>4</sub>-N present or formed is steam distilled into a H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> solution and the amount present calculated following titration with dilute mineral acid to pH 5.0. Depending on how the method is utilised, it is possible to measure or estimate the following mineral-N fractions: NH<sub>4</sub>-N, (NO<sub>3</sub>-N + NO<sub>2</sub>-N), (NH<sub>4</sub>-N + NO<sub>3</sub>-N + NO<sub>2</sub>-N), and (NH<sub>4</sub>-N + NO<sub>3</sub>-N). Also, both <a id="page_123"></a>NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N can be obtained by difference. There are five notes pertinent to 7C1 Methods, listed following Method 7C1h.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 10.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a 250 mL plastic extracting bottle and add 100 mL 2 M KCl extracting solution. Stopper securely and mechanically shake end-over-end at &#8776;25&#176;C for 1 h; see Notes 1 and 2, located immediately following Method 7C1h.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_124"></a>Allow soil extracts to clear (usually around 30 min) then take a known aliquot (e.g. 20 mL) for steam distillation. If soil extracts need to be stored prior to final analysis, filter (Whatman No. 42) and store in refrigerator (&#8776;4&#176;C) or deep freeze until required for analysis; see Note 3 of Notes for 7C1 Methods.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Proceed with analytical measurements by Method 7C1a, 7C1b, 7C1c, 7C1d, 7C1e, 7C1f, 7C1g, or 7C1h as applicable.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Notes for 7C1 Methods</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Make periodic checks on recovery of the various mineral-N components by substituting relevant aliquots of the two N standard solutions, diluted as necessary with 2 M KCl extracting solution.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Field extraction or use of field-moist soil is necessary for accurate estimates of NO<sub>2</sub>-N and are often preferred for precise studies of soil mineral-N content. Make due allowances for a variable soil/solution ratio and for the additional moisture added.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">3.&#160;&#160;Unfiltered soil extracts based on 2 M KCl can be stored safely up to 24 h at 25&#176;C and for up to 48 h at 4&#176;C. Filtered extracts can be stored for at least 45 days at 25&#176;C and for up to 4 months at &#8804;4&#176;C.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">4.&#160;&#160;It is not necessary to use accurately weighed amounts of MgO and Devarda&#8217;s alloy. Calibrated glass or stainless steel scoops are satisfactory.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">5.&#160;&#160;<a href="#ch07ref10">Best and Craswell (1985)</a> have shown that 2 M KCl soil extracts containing in excess of 0.02 M Mg can interfere in the determination of NO<sub>3</sub>-N based on use of Devarda&#8217;s alloy and subsequent steam distillation. Recoveries can be as low as 25%. The 1:10 soil/solution ratio used in this method overcame the interference on all soils tested. For narrow soil/solution ratios, as might occur with field extraction of moist soil, 0.4 g of Devarda&#8217;s alloy for a 20 mL aliquot of the 2 M KCl soil extract was always sufficient to achieve full recoveries.</p>
