<p class="para">Two different methods utilise 0.01 M Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> as the extractant for soil S, one with and the other without activated charcoal. The method with charcoal (10C1) with the acronym (CPC-S) is used predominantly in Victoria, where it has been correlated with responses of local pastures to applications of S fertiliser (<a href="#ch10ref22">Peverill and Briner 1974</a>). The other, with analytical finishes coded as Methods 10B1, 10B2 and 10B3 in <a href="#ch10ref29">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a> and similarly in this chapter has been more widely adopted (e.g. <a href="#ch10ref30">Rayment 1983</a>, <a href="#ch10ref27">1984</a>). There is also an IC option (Method 10B4). Moreover, measurement performance for over a decade, particularly for Method 10B3 (see <a href="#ch10fig1">Figure 10.1</a>), is available from ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs, such as those reported by <a href="#ch10ref23">Peverill and Johnstone (1997)</a> and <a href="#ch10ref20">Lyons <em>et al.</em> (2008)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Manual distillation (<a href="#ch10ref14">Johnson and Nishita 1952</a>) and automated distillation are analytical options but are relatively slow and expensive to perform. ICPAES is the preferred analytical finish, because of its analytical convenience, wide dynamic range, and speed of measurement. It includes all forms of S in solution. The IC alternative is restricted only to soluble SO<sub>4</sub>-S.</p>
