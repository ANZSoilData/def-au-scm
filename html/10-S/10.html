<h2 class="h2a">Sulfur</h2>
<p class="para">Sulfur (S) is an essential plant nutrient distributed heterogeneously throughout the earth&#8217;s crust and soils. The element and its compounds exhibit five different oxidation states, including four in geological environments and as S<sup>6</sup> in gases and sulfates (<a href="#ch10ref33">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). Total S concentrations range widely from 3 to over 10 000 mg S/kg, with a mean around 430 mg S/kg. Pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) and pyrrhotite (Fe<sub>n</sub>S<sub>n+1</sub>) are common sulfide minerals, and many of the metals of economic importance occur as sulfides (Ure and Berrow 1982).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Many different forms of organic and inorganic fractions of S occur in soils and in soil OM (<a href="#ch10ref35">Williams 1975</a>). In general, organic S fractions are highly correlated with TOC and TSN. The C/N/organic-S ratio of soils is commonly around 140:10:1.3 (<a href="#ch10ref24">Probert and Samosir 1983)</a>. Long-term studies on cultivated soils, however, have shown a decline in organic S levels of 50% in 20&#8211;30 years (<a href="#ch10ref15">Kamprath and Till 1983</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">In aerobic soils of humid regions, most S is in the organic fraction. As with N, this organically bound S must be mineralised before it becomes available to plants, predominantly as sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>). There are important exceptions, however. For example, sulfides (S<sup>2&#8211;</sup>) predominate in acid-sulfate soils (see <a href="chapter20.html#chapter20">Chapter 20</a>), in recent marine deposits, and in many mining-waste dumps, while elemental S can exist in and around areas of recent volcanic activity and associated soils. Inorganic, solid-phase S (notably gypsum; CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) is very common at the wetting front of soil profiles in semi-arid and arid regions of inland northern Australia (<a href="#ch10ref26">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The reactive surfaces of highly weathered clays and the surfaces of Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides can adsorb relatively large amounts of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, but this propensity decreases as phosphate concentrations increase and as soils become less acidic (<a href="#ch10ref15">Kamprath and Till 1983</a>). Sulfate ions can displace NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> from anion exchange surfaces when present at similar soil solution activities. The chemical activity of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> in soil solutions allows the formation of ionic species such as CaSO<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup> and AlSO<sub>4</sub>1+ (<a href="#ch10ref01">Adams 1974</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The focus of this chapter is on the chemical measurement of soil S, particularly as a plant nutrient. For interpretative information, refer to <a href="#ch10ref19">Lewis (1999)</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Total S</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Measurements of total S are undertaken to assess the size of the soil S pool. Concentrations &#62;0.5% S and certainly &#62;1.0% S also warn of the likely presence of potential or actual ASS (see <a href="chapter20.html#chapter20">Chapter 20</a>). In general, total S is poorly correlated with plant response to applied S fertiliser, except when soil S reserves are very low. Total S is also a poor indicator of a soil&#8217;s tendency to corrode concrete, except at concentrations of &#8805;1% S, particularly under oxidising conditions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two methods for total soil S are included. The first is based on X-ray fluorescence with dry-powder pellets. The second is a combustion furnace method, similar to equivalent <a id="page_206"></a>procedures for TOC and TSN. Both require sophisticated laboratory instrumentation available from several manufacturers.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Wet digestion methods with mineral acids are available but may not always yield quantitative results, because of the possibility of S loss during digestion. If this option is necessary, methods in which oxidation occurs under alkaline conditions are preferred. See wet-digestion methods provided in <a href="chapter17.html#chapter17">Chapter 17</a>, in addition to the suggestions of <a href="#ch10ref25">Randall and Sakai (1983)</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Water-soluble and Adsorbed S</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">The quantity of water-soluble and adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> in the root-zone of soils has a major influence on the incidence of S deficiencies in agriculture (<a href="#ch10ref10">Ensminger 1954</a>; <a href="#ch10ref11">Fox <em>et al.</em> 1964</a>). Water-soluble SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, especially when associated with Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, also promote attack on concrete and other materials containing concrete, whether in the subsurface or at the surface. Gypsum is much less corrosive, unless groundwater in its proximity is continually replenished (<a href="#ch10ref13">Head 1980</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Several extractants have been used to measure &#8216;plant-available&#8217; soil S (e.g. <a href="#ch10ref11">Fox <em>et al.</em> 1964</a>; <a href="#ch10ref22">Peverill and Briner 1974</a>; <a href="#ch10ref02">Andrew 1975</a>; <a href="#ch10ref05">Barrow 1975</a>; <a href="#ch10ref17">Lee <em>et al.</em> 1981</a>; <a href="#ch10ref25">Randall and Sakai 1983</a>). These dominantly contain H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> ions but also include Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<a href="#ch10ref07">Blair <em>et al.</em> 1991</a>). Carrier cations vary. Calcium is preferred by most, because it helps to flocculate colloids, resulting in clearer extracts and less difficulty in interpreting the nature of the extracted S (<a href="#ch10ref25">Randall and Sakai 1983</a>). <a href="#ch10ref32">Spencer (1979)</a> proposed the use of 0.04M magnesium phosphate at pH 5.0 at a 1:20 soil/solution ratio with extraction for 2 h, mainly to improve the extraction of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> from highly weathered Australian soils of high SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> sorption capacity.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch10ref07">Blair <em>et al.</em> (1991)</a> found that 40&#176;C soil extraction with 0.25 M potassium chloride (KCl) at a soil/solution ratio of 1:6.67 for 3 h (KCl-40) favours the removal of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> and labile forms of organic S, which they found attractive from a diagnostic soil-testing viewpoint. There are mixed views as to whether there is need to include decontaminated active charcoal in extracting solutions of 0.01 M calcium dihydrogen phosphate [Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#183;H<sub>2</sub>O], also referred to as MCP.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The chapter includes three principal methods for soil-extractable S (dominantly sulfate), two based on 0.01 M Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, one with and the other without active charcoal. The third method is that of <a href="#ch10ref07">Blair <em>et al.</em> (1991)</a>, involving KCl-40. Several analytical options for the measurement of SO<sub>4</sub>-S are offered, including manual and automated distillation procedures based on <a href="#ch10ref14">Johnson and Nishita (1952)</a>. The others are ICPAES and IC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Mehlich 3 multi-element extraction, followed by analysis by ICPAES (Method 18F1) extends the options available for extractable S. The test correlates strongly with Method 10B3 (D Lyons, unpublished data).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Soil preparation</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Soil samples for S, irrespective of test, are best kept at &#8804;4&#176;C during transport to the laboratory, where they are usually dried, ground, sieved and stored before analysis. These processes enable soils to be analysed for a wide range of elements in addition to S.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is evidence (<a href="#ch10ref28">Rayment 1993</a>) that levels of phosphate-extractable S in air-dry soils are affected by storage conditions. For example, concentrations increased in storage for about 13 weeks then decreased slightly over the following 20 weeks to levels 2.5 to 3 times higher than those present immediately following air drying (<a href="#ch10ref31">Spencer 1974</a>). Unpublished data (GE Rayment and GA Barry) for phosphate-extractable S in soils from established pastures in south-east Queensland confirm that increases do occur, particularly in surface soils with good reserves of OC. Low temperature storage (3&#176;C) did not prevent changes occurring in apparent soil S status (<a href="#ch10ref31">Spencer 1974</a>). Clearly, there is a need for caution when using stored samples for soil test calibrations and other purposes.</p>
