<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter03sec02"></a>3B1 Estimated soluble salt concentration</h3>
<p class="para">An approximate indication of the concentration of soluble salts in soil can be obtained by calculation from EC<sub>1:5</sub>. Assumptions include (a) that Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> dominate the soluble anions in the soil, which is not always the case, and (b) the gram-equivalent weight of the soluble salts is around 51 or greater (<a href="#ch03ref12">Jackson 1958</a>). In addition, the presence of gypsum can upset the relationship with EC<sub>1:5</sub>, as can the different ionic conductivities of particular soluble salts and the influence of soil surface properties.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch03ref19">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a> suggested the approximate percentage of TSS could be obtained by multiplying the EC<sub>1:5</sub> value by 0.34, which derives from the relationships reported by <a href="#ch03ref12">Jackson (1958)</a> and <a href="#ch03ref26">US Salinity Laboratory Staff (1954)</a>, with allowance for a 1:5 soil/water ratio. Earlier, <a href="#ch03ref17">Piper (1944)</a> used a factor of 0.375, derived from actual correlations of specific conductivities (at 20&#176;C) with the amounts of soluble salts determined gravimetrically in a large number of Australian soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">While the value 0.336 is used in the following calculation, it is noteworthy that more refined estimates are available for particular Australian locations. For example, <a href="#ch03ref30">Williams and Semple (2001)</a> reported the following relationship for saline seepage scalds from Central Western New South Wales, where measured soil salt concentrations ranged from 0.19&#8211;1.8%. Specifically, TSS (%) = 0.165 + 0.225*EC<sub>1:5</sub>, where EC<sub>1:5</sub> has units of dS/m. This relationship gives higher values (relative to the calculation provided below) at EC<sub>1:5</sub> values around 0.15 dS/m and similar values in the EC<sub>1:5</sub> range 0.9&#8211;2.0 dS/m.</p>
