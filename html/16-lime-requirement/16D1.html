<p class="para">This method (<a href="#ch16ref07">Dunn 1943</a>) for indicating amounts of limestone required to raise soil pH to prescribed levels is based on measurement of pH following equilibration for 4 days of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) with graded concentrations of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>].</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>0.02 M Calcium Hydroxide Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Calcine a quantity of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) as described in Method 10B1. Dissolve 1.1216 g of the calcined material (CaO) and make to 1 L with CO<sub>3</sub>-free deionised water to produce a limewater solution of &#8776;0.02 M Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Avoid subsequent contact with the atmosphere. Confirm molarity by standardisation with acid, in a similar manner to that described in Method 4D1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 10.0 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a series of 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Add graded volumes of 0.02 M Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> to each, on the assumption that 5.0 mL of 0.02 M Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &#8211; when added to 10 g of soil &#8211; is equivalent to 1 t/ha of pulverised limestone with an AV of 90%, applied to a depth of about 20 cm on many soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute to 100 mL with deionised water, add 3 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to suppress microbial activity, stopper flasks, and shake well (briefly by hand). Allow to stand at &#8776;25&#176;C for 4 days, with brief, thorough shaking twice daily. Soil type, initial soil pH, and desired soil pH will influence the number of sub-samples to be used and the volumes of 0.02 M Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> added.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In a similar manner to Method 4A1, determine the pH of the suspensions. Subsequently construct a titration curve (or regression equation) for each soil by plotting pH values on the ordinate and &#8216;kg pulverised agricultural limestone equivalent&#8217; on the abscissa. Read off the approximate quantity of limestone necessary to achieve the preferred soil pH.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report Dunn lime requirement (t/ha 20 cm) and the preferred (target) pH.</p>
