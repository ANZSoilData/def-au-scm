<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter16sec01"></a>16A1 Calculated lime rate &#8211; from exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup></h3>
<p class="para">Several investigators have proposed that lime rates for acidic, highly weathered soils should be based on the amount of exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> present (e.g., <a href="#ch16ref08">Kamprath 1970</a>), rather than on raising soil to a predetermined value such as pH 6.5. This method is based on findings (<a href="#ch16ref13">Mendez and Kamprath 1978</a>) that liming rates equivalent to exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> &#215; 1.5 can neutralise most of any toxic Al present, thus creating suitable soil conditions for the growth of most plants.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method has limitations, especially when the presence of sulfides and the likelihood of manganese toxicity contribute to acid soil infertility. Moreover, calculation-factors other than 1.5 may be necessary in some situations (e.g., <a href="#ch16ref05">Cochrane <em>et al.</em> 1980</a>). This method&#8217;s main advantage over Method 16B1 is that an estimate of exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> by Method 15G1 is the only analytical requirement.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Calculation and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="indent-parav">Lime requirement (kg CaCO<sub>3</sub>/ha 10 cm) = 750 &#215; cmol<sub>c</sub>Al/kg of the soil segment</p>
<p class="indent-para">where:</p>
<p class="hangindent-parav1">&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;cmol<sub>c</sub>Al/kg is for a specified 10 cm profile segment, and</p>
<p class="hangindent-parav">&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;rates of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (agricultural grade; see Note 1) are additive for each 10 cm profile segment under consideration.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">Make appropriate adjustments if soil bulk density varies from 1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and/or if the expected efficiency of agricultural limestone varies from 100%.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report lime requirement (kg CaCO<sub>3</sub>/ha 10 cm).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Note</em></strong></h3>
<p class="hangindent-parav2">1.&#160;&#160;The effectiveness/efficiency of liming materials depends on particle size and chemical composition, in addition to the amount applied (e.g. <a href="#ch16ref16">van Lierop 1985</a>; <a href="#ch16ref14">Oldham 2007</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-parav1">Fine material reacts much more quickly and is therefore more effective than more coarsely ground limestones, coral sand and the like. Lime that passes a 60 mesh sieve is commonly rated as having an efficiency rating (ER) for fineness = 100%; that passing through a 20 but not a 60 mesh sieve = 60%; that passing an 8 but not a 20 mesh sieve = 20%; while that not passing through an 8 mesh sieve = 0. These ERs take account of the time required to dissolve the limestone. Assuming a limestone contains 78.8%, 10%, 2.4% and 7.8% of each sieve size fraction, then the fineness ER would equate to 85.28%.</p>
<p class="indent-parav1">The other key product variable is the product&#8217;s neutralising value (NV) or neutralising capacity, which is determined chemically and expressed as a percentage of pure CaCO<sub>3</sub> (chemically pure CaCO<sub>3</sub> has a NV of 100%; dolomitic limestone has a theoretical NV of 108%). Impurities such as clays in limestone reduce NVs.</p>
<p class="indent-parav1">To determine the effectiveness/efficiency or AV of limestones, the particle size ER has to be adjusted by the NV, plus an additional adjustment for moisture content (MC) of the limestone. For example, a limestone having an ER of 85%, a NV of 95%, and a MC of 13%, has an AV = {85% ER &#215; 0.95 NV &#215; [1.00 &#8211; 0.13 MC]} = 70.25%.</p>
