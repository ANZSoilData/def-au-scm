<p class="para">This method is chemically similar to Method 19B1, except it uses a corrosion-resistant gas-pressure transducer (see Note 1) with a direct current voltage (Vdc) range sufficient to quantify the pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> developed by chemical reaction as the measurement step. As the chemical reaction is performed in a closed vessel at constant temperature, the pressure increase within the vessel is proportional to the amount of carbonate in the soil, assuming the chemical reaction goes to completion. In addition to soils, the method has been applied to marine sediments with very high carbonate contents of &#62;80% (<a href="#ch19ref04">Fernandes <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Since calibration of the system uses high-grade calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), any dolomite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>&#8226;MgCO<sub>3</sub>) present will be measured as if it was CaCO<sub>3</sub>: see Note 2. As with Method 19B1, ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>) is incorporated to prevent interference from reactions of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) with OM in the presence of HCl (<a href="#ch19ref09">Martin and Reeve 1955</a>).</p>

<p class="para">Commission a suitable transducer/s, preferably with a 0&#8211;10 or 0&#8211;12 Vdc range at the pressures expected to be generated. Ideally, the output voltage of the transducer should not be a direct function of excitation, allowing use with a reasonable quality, unregulated power supply. A companion digital volt meter should be selected to perform efficiently to about 6 Vdc above the expected electrical output of the pressure transducer/s; e.g. to 20 Vdc.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>System Calibration (and Measurement)</em></p>
<p class="para">Accurately weigh known quantities of reagent grade calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>, previously dried by heating at 110&#176;C to constant weight, then pulverized to pass a 100 mesh (&#60;150 &#956;m) sieve) plus corresponding weights of Silica Sand (to give a total weight of CaCO<sub>3</sub> + Silica Sand of 2.0 g) into separate, clean 40 mL vials. Refer to <a href="#ch19tab3">Table 19.3</a> for suggested weights and corresponding &#8216;soil&#8217; % CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentrations, which should be selected to suit the optimum voltage output response of the transducer, plus the soil CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentrations expected by the laboratory. A continuous relationship between transducer voltage and % CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentration (see <a href="#ch19fig2">Figure 19.2</a>) for a 2.0 g soil sample weight (air-dry) should be developed for each transducer used by the laboratory.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Into each 40 mL vial containing the known-weights of CaCO<sub>3</sub>/Sand, insert a 4 mL vial (see Note 3) containing 2.0 mL of 5.5 M HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent, then seal each 40 mL vial with a gas-tight screw cap and septum. Next invert carefully, allowing the HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent and the CaCO<sub>3</sub> to come into full contact, swirl to mix, then allow the chemical reaction to proceed at ambient temperature for 2 h with occasional swirling. The temperature of the contents of the vials at the time of these transducer-voltage measurements should be known and recorded; the preferred temperature is 25&#176;C.</p>

<p class="indent-para1">Power-up the transducer and set the digital volt meter to its 20 Vdc range (or in accord with the output specifications of the transducer) and ensure the equipment is fully operational. Next push the syringe needle (see Note 5) associated with the transducer through the septum on the lid of each of the 40 mL vials and sequentially record the respective voltage reading of each reference &#8216;standard&#8217;. Subsequently plot (or fit a continuous linear model) to transducer-voltage reading vs corresponding soil-equivalent % CaCO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 19.2.</strong> Hypothetical example of a continuous linear relationship between voltage output (Vdc) by transducer relative to the corresponding % CaCO<sub>3</sub> for an air-dry soil weight of 2.0 g. The actual relationship needs to be established for each transducer and the desired range of CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentrations (see Note 4).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_422"></a>Spot-check the transducer-voltage reading vs corresponding soil-equivalent % CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentration with each batch of unknown samples to ensure the equipment is performing within specifications. Accordingly, accurately weigh, for example, 0.04 g of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (as previously described) plus 1.96 g Silica Sand, into a separate 40 mL vial. Into this, insert a 4 mL vial containing 2.0 mL of 5.5 M HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent and proceed as described above. If the voltage does not correspond to that predicted from the calibration plot (or regression equation) recheck the equipment and (if necessary) re-establish the calibration relationship with the same or a replacement transducer.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sample Extraction and Measurement</em></p>
<p class="para">Into each 40 mL vial containing 2.0 g of air-dry soil (&#60;0.5 mm), insert a 4 mL vial containing 2.0 mL of 5.5 M HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent, then seal each 40 mL vial with a gas-tight screw cap and septum. Next invert carefully, allowing the HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent and the soil sample to come into full contact, swirl to mix, then allow the chemical reaction to proceed at ambient temperature for 2 h with occasional swirling. The temperature of the contents of the vials at the time of recording transducer-voltages should be the same as that used for calibration of the equipment, ideally 25&#176;C. Make sequential transducer-voltage measurements as described in the System Calibration and Measurement sub-section. Voltages for all samples should be within the range of the calibration standard plot. It is, however, recommended the analysis of unknown samples be repeated if the transducer output of the type described exceeds 5&#8211;6 Vdc. In such circumstances, the sample weight should be lowered to &#8804;1.0 g with Silica Sand used to bring the sample + sand weight to 2.0 g. Allowance for this &#8216;dilution&#8217; must be made when reporting results.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Calcium and magnesium carbonates in dolomite can theoretically occur in the ratio 54.35% CaCO<sub>3</sub> to 45.65% MgCO<sub>3</sub>. The quantity of MgCO<sub>3</sub> in natural dolomites can vary upwards from 10% MgCO<sub>3</sub>. Other minerals that also belong to the dolomite group include ankerite [Ca(Fe, Mg, Mn)(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], benstonite [(Ba, Sr)<sub>6</sub>(Ca, Mn)<sub>6</sub>Mg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>13</sub>], huntite [CaMg<sub>3</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>], kutnohorite [Ca(Mn, Mg, Fe)(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], minrecordite [CaZn(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] and norsethite [BaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>].</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">3.&#160;&#160;A gelatin capsule may be used as the &#8216;vial&#8217;, but as there may be acid spillage while filling, this step must be done with care, away from the immediate presence of other laboratory staff.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">4.&#160;&#160;To extend the calibration range when the laboratory expects to handle many soils high in carbonate, one option is to calibrate the transducer as if double the weight of soil sample (4.0 g) were used. In this circumstance, results based on a 2.0 g soil sample would need to be multiplied by two for reporting purposes.</p>
