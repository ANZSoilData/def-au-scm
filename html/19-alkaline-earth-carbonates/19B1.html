<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter19sec03"></a>19B1 Carbonates by pressure change &#8211; manometric</h3>
<p class="para">This method is based on measurement of pressure change with time (constant temperature) via a manometer in a closed system, as CO<sub>2</sub> is evolved following reaction of carbonate with a solution of HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub>. Ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>) is incorporated to prevent interference from reactions of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) with OM in the presence of HCl (<a href="#ch19ref09">Martin and Reeve 1955</a>). Calcite (or limestone) can be estimated separately from dolomite because the reaction rate of the former is more rapid. Fine grinding to &#60;0.5 mm helps ensure the reagents have sufficient surface area to achieve complete reaction with contained carbonates. The effervescent chemical reaction based on calcite is as follows:</p>
<p class="center-para">CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl &#8594; H<sub>2</sub> O + CO<sub>2</sub>&#8593; + Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 2Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_418"></a><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>4 M Hydrochloric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">Dilute 400 mL of 10 M HCl by adding acid to water, mix and make volume to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 30 g ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O) in 1.0 L of 4 M HCl immediately prior to use.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Acid-washed Sand</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 15B1. Alternatively, treat a batch of high-grade silica sand with 5.5 M HCl in the same proportions described in this procedure. Subsequently, wash the sand free of any residual acidity with deionised water, oven-dry (105&#176;C), cool and store.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Into a clean 20 or 25 mL vial, weigh 5.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;0.5 mm). There should be sufficient carbonate present to give a final manometer reading of 80&#8211;100 mm Hg. If &#60;5.0 g soil is needed, add a corresponding weight of Acid-washed Sand to the vial. Float the vial plus soil on 30 mL HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Solution in a 700 mL wide mouth reaction bottle.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Insert a two-hole stopper carrying a thermometer and a glass tube (fitted with a gas-tight stopcock) into each reaction bottle (the seal should be gas tight). Clamp the reaction bottles into a wrist-action shaker and connect a Hg manometer (or a hand-held gauge and differential manometer, such as Omega Engineering&#8217;s PCL-200 series or equivalent; <a href="#ch19ref01">Anon 1996</a>). Arrange the apparatus so that at least the reaction bottle is maintained at &#8776;25&#176;C in a waterbath or constant temperature room. After checking the zero reading of the manometer, set the shaker in motion (contents of the vial must make contact with the HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Solution) and with vigorous shaking (and the stopcock open) make periodic readings of the manometer until no change in pressure occurs. Temperature should also be recorded and if not at 25&#176;C, an appropriate correction should be made (see Note 1); heat of neutralisation is unlikely to raise temperature appreciably. Use insulated gloves to prevent heat transfer when handling the reaction bottles. Also react a known weight (e.g. 0.05 g) of pure, dry CaCO<sub>3</sub> as a check on the analytical procedure, the equipment and the quality of reagents. Method 19B2 provides examples.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Subtract manometer readings (H<sub>t1</sub>; H<sub>t2</sub>; H<sub>t3</sub>; etc), recorded at each time interval from the final manometer reading (H<sub>f</sub>). Plot log (H<sub>f</sub>&#8211;H<sub>t</sub>) against time (s); log-linear graph paper or spreadsheet is convenient. Extrapolate the straight-line portion of the plot occurring after about 60 sec to zero time. This intercept value (H<sub>d</sub>) represents CO<sub>2</sub> derived from dolomite; the difference between the final reading and the intercept (H<sub>f</sub>&#8211;H<sub>d</sub>) represents CO<sub>2</sub> from calcite (or limestone). Examples are given in <a href="#ch19fig1">Figure 19.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Convert these values to g CO<sub>2</sub> by means of a standard curve (or regression equation) prepared by measuring CO<sub>2</sub> evolved from different amounts of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The deficit in weight of CaCO<sub>3</sub> from that of a 5 g soil sample should be compensated for by addition of acid-washed sand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine actual weights of CO<sub>2</sub> from calcite and/or dolomite using theoretical CO<sub>2</sub> contents of 43.97% and 47.73%, respectively: see Note 2 for additional examples. Adjust for weight of soil used.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report % CaCO<sub>3</sub> (calcium carbonate) and % CaCO<sub>3</sub>&#8226;MgCO<sub>3</sub> (dolomite) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio for the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
