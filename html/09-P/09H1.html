<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec21"></a>9H1 Anion Storage Capacity (previously P Retention)</h3>
<p class="para">The method described (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref73">Saunders 1965</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref74">1968</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref09">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) was devised to differentiate between soils exhibiting high and low P (anion) retention/storage; however, its ability to characterise the smaller differences that can exist in the retention characteristics of closely related soil types is relatively low. When this is required, a P sorption curve (Methods 9J1, 9J2) or alternative P sorption index or P buffer capacity methods are available. See Method 9I for information on P index methods.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This simple empirical method was designed to reflect maximum anion storage capacity (P retention) as a result of pH adjustment to 4.6. A nitric-vanadomolybdate acid reagent is used for the manual determination of P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The original ratings of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref74">Saunders (1968)</a> have been expanded to embrace five classes as follows: very low &#60;10%, low 10&#8211;30%, medium 30&#8211;60%, high 60&#8211;90%, very high &#62;90% (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref22">Cox 1978</a>). This P (anion) retention/storage test is included in the Soil Taxonomy criteria for confirmation of the dominance of amorphous material in the soil exchange complex (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref80">Thomas <em>et al.</em> 1979</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Anion Retention Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">1 mL contains 1 mg of P (i.e. 1000 mg P/L).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 4.3936 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, previously dried at 130&#176;C for 2 h) and 16.4 g anhydrous sodium acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COONa) in deionised water, add 11.5 mL glacial acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH; 17 M) and dilute to 1.0 L in a volumetric flask. Solution pH should be adjusted to 4.6 &#177; 0.05.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Nitric-Vanadomolybdate Acid Reagent</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 0.80 g ammonium metavanadate (NH<sub>4</sub>VO<sub>3</sub>) in 500 mL boiling distilled water, cool, add 6.0 mL nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>; 14 M) and dilute to 1.0 L with distilled water. Separately dissolve 16.0 g ammonium molybdate [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O] in distilled water (heat to maximum of 50&#176;C if necessary), cool and dilute to 1.0 L. Also prepare a HNO<sub>3</sub> solution by diluting <a id="page_186"></a>100 mL 14 M HNO<sub>3</sub> to 1000 mL with distilled water. To the dilute HNO<sub>3</sub>, add the Vanadate Solution, then the Molybdate Solution and mix well. (See Note 1 of Method 9B2 on the reason for preferring distilled water.)</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Anion Retention Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Dispense accurately 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mL aliquots of the Anion Retention Solution into 50 mL volumetric flasks and make to volume with deionised water. These contain 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 g P/L and correspond to 100, 80, 60, 40, 20 and 0% P-retention, respectively.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 5.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into stoppered 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes, add 25 mL Anion Retention Solution and shake for 16 h at 25&#176;C. Centrifuge or filter to clarify.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Take 1 mL aliquots (automatic diluter preferred) from samples, add 19 mL Nitric-Vanadomolybdate Acid Reagent and shake well. Treat the Anion Retention Working Standards in an identical manner.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Read absorbance after at least 30 min at 466 nm, setting the colorimeter/spectrometer to read zero on deionised water. Determine % Anion Storage from a calibration curve of % Anion (P) Storage against absorbance.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report as Anion Storage (%) on an air-dry basis.</p>
