<p class="para">Lactate is a successful extractant for predicting yield response to P on non-acidic wheat-growing soils in New South Wales (NSW) (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref20">Colwell 1970</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref36a">Holford <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref35">Holford and Cullis 1985</a>). The method, however, has not found wide use across Australasia. A strength is that lactate integrates the quantity and intensity components of labile P and hence gives a critical value for P response that does not vary with changing soil buffer capacity.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The extracting solution can be either calcium lactate in dilute HCl or ammonium lactate in dilute CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, but Ca-lactate is preferred as it is simpler to prepare. It is claimed both reagents extract similar quantities of soil P and have the same critical value for wheat (18 mg P/kg) in NSW.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Extracting Solution &#8211; 0.02 M Calcium Lactate in 0.01 M HCl</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 30.83 g calcium lactate {[CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)COO]<sub>2</sub>Ca.5H<sub>2</sub>O} in deionised water, add 5 mL 10 M HCl and make to 5.0 L with deionised water. The pH should be 3.7.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>2.25 M Sulfuric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para1"><em>Reagent A (Ammonium Molybdate &#8211; Sulfuric Acid &#8211; Sb Solution)</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 12.0 g ammonium molybdate [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O] in 250 mL distilled (preferred) or deionised water. Separately dissolve 0.2908 g potassium antimony tartrate (KSbO.C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in 100 mL distilled/deionised water. Add both solutions to 1.0 L of cool 2.25 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (prepared using distilled water), dilute to 2.0 L with distilled water and mix thoroughly. Store in a dark, cool place (&#8776;4&#176;C) in borosilicate glass for up to several months.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Mixed Colour Reagent</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 1.32 g <em>l</em>-ascorbic acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in 250 mL Reagent A. This reagent should be prepared on day of use.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_174"></a><em>Phosphorus Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 9A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Secondary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 5 mg of P</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute 10.0 mL P Primary Standard to 100 mL with deionised water.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1.00 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL flask or bottle, and add 50 mL 0.02 M Calcium Lactate in 0.01 M HCl Extractant. Stopper and shake for 90 min at 25&#176;C on a slow end-over-end or high-speed orbital shaker. Centrifuge or filter extract through Whatman No. 42 fluted paper. Pipette 25 mL of particulate-free extract into 100 mL volumetric flask. Add 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent and dilute to 100 mL with deionised water.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Concurrently, take 0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 mL aliquots of the P Secondary Standard in 100 mL volumetric flasks, add 25 mL extractant, 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent, and dilute each standard to 100 mL with deionised water. Mix well. These working standards contain 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 mg P/L. For a 1:50 soil/solution ratio and a 25 mL aliquot diluted to 100 mL, these working standards contain equivalent to soil concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg P/kg.</p>
<p class="indent-para">After 30 min (colour is stable for 24 h) measure absorbance at 882 nm (preferred) or 720 nm of the samples, standards, and a reagent blank, against deionised water as a reference. Prepare a calibration curve (or regression equation) of absorbance against concentration of the working standards. Interpolate or calculate the concentrations of the samples and reagent blank from the graph (or equivalent). Dilute soil extracts of high P concentrations with 0.02 M Calcium Lactate in 0.01 M HCl Extracting Solution prior to analysis.</p>
