<p class="para">Particularly since the findings of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref05">Bache and Williams (1971)</a>, different &#8216;P index&#8217; methods have emerged. Regional contributors in addition to the Anion Storage Capacity test of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref73">Saunders (1965</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref74">1968</a>) and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref09">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1987)</a> include <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref35">Holford and Cullis (1985)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> (1988)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref23">Dear <em>et al.</em> (1992)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref16">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> (2002</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref17">2008</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The main principles for selecting the &#8216;index&#8217; method to use are:</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras1">&#8226;&#160;&#160;effective across a wide range of soils;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;national/international use or acceptance;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;analytical robust method, suited to automation or rapid throughput at low cost, with stable reagents and good within and between laboratory agreement on results, and</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras2">&#8226;&#160;&#160;interpretative criteria available or easily developed.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Full analytical details for Method 9I1 (Phosphate Sorption Index) have been available for years (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref68">Rayment and Higginson 1992</a>); however, it has not been used widely. The Anion Storage Capacity test (Method 9H1) has greater support, particularly in New Zealand. It has an application in Soil Taxonomy and in New Zealand&#8217;s revised soil classification system.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A P index test (termed PBI) was developed, particularly for use in Australia (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref16">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). The expectation was that PBI would better reflect changes in P sorptivity or P &#8216;fixing&#8217; ability of fertilised soils. That test incorporates a measure of contemporary soil P fertility (either Colwell-P or Olsen-P), although more recent research suggests it may be preferable not to adjust the index for current soil P fertility (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref17">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>). Methods with (9I2 and 9I3) and without (9I4) adjustments for current soil P fertility are included, inclusive of alternative analytical &#8216;finishes&#8217;.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The acronym for PBI when it incorporates the Colwell-P test as the measure of current soil P fertility is PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub>. Its companion, based on Olsen-P, is PBI<sub>&#43;OlsenP</sub>. When neither is used, it is PBI<sub>unadj</sub>.</p>
