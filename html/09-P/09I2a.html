<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec24"></a>9I2a P buffer index &#8211; PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub> &#8211; Murphy and Riley</h3>
<p class="para">ASPAC in 2001 adopted PBI as its preferred method for characterising the P buffer capacity (P sorptivity or P &#8216;fixing&#8217; ability) of soils. The index was developed to be applicable across Australian soils, and has been correlated with other indices for measuring PBC. The development of PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub> and PBI<sub>&#43;OlsenP</sub> and their relationships to other single point indices, is described in <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref16">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub> or PBI<sub>&#43;OlsenP</sub> can be used to: (a) assess the potential for leaching of soluble P through the soil; (b) adjust &#8216;critical&#8217; Colwell-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>) values or ranges for optimum crop/pasture production; and (c) calculate &#8216;capital&#8217; P fertiliser requirements for raising the existing Colwell- or Olsen-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref58">Olsen <em>et al.</em> 1954</a>) level to the appropriate &#8216;critical&#8217; level.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This method (PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub>) utilises the Colwell-P test as the measure of current soil P fertility. It also incorporates the colorimetric <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> analytical finish. Alternative analytical finishes for the PBI component are provided that can slightly affect the results. A similar suite of methods (Methods 9I3a, b, c) provide for the use of Olsen-P as the measure of current soil P fertility, while Method 9I4 excludes a measure of current soil P fertility.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub></em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 1.4702 g calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) in deionised water and make volume to 1.0 L.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Reagent A (Ammonium Molybdate &#8211; Sulfuric Acid &#8211; Sb Solution)</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 12.0 g ammonium molybdate [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O] in 400 mL of warm (not above 50&#176;C) distilled (preferred) or deionised water. Cool then add 140 mL sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; 18 M) slowly and with stirring to another 400 mL distilled or deionised water and re-cool. In a further 100 mL distilled or deionised water, dissolve 0.2669 g potassium antimony tartrate (KSbO.C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>). Combine by adding initially the ammonium molybdate solution to the diluted H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, stirring continuously. Re-cool, add the potassium antimony tartrate solution and make volume to 1.0 L. Store in borosilicate glass at &#8776;4&#176;C to achieve a shelf life of several months. This solution contains 1.2% ammonium molybdate and 0.1 mg Sb/mL in &#8776;2.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. See Note 1 of Method 9B2 on the reason for preferring distilled water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Mixed Colour Reagent</em></p>
<p class="para">For each 100 mL required, dissolve 1.056 g <em>l</em>-ascorbic acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in 100 mL of Reagent A. Prepare only as required as the shelf life does not exceed 24 h.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphate Equilibrating Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 100 mg P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 2.1964 g potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; previously dried at 130&#176;C for 2 h) in deionised water. Also dissolve 7.351 g calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) in deionised water. Mix, and make volume to 5.0 L. Add 10 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to suppress biological activity. Store the solution in borosilicate glass, preferably cool (&#8776;4&#176;C) and in the dark, where it remains stable for at least 6 months.</p>

<p class="para">1 L contains 100 mg P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 0.4393 g potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; previously dried at 130&#176;C for 2 h) in deionised water. Also dissolve 1.4702 g calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) in deionised water. Mix, and make volume to 1.0 L. Add 2 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to suppress biological activity. Store the solution in borosilicate glass, preferably cool (&#8776;4&#176;C) and in the dark, where it remains stable for at least 6 months.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_190"></a><em>Phosphorus Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Add aliquots of the P Primary Standard to 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> to achieve final working standards ranging from 0 to 10 mg P/L in 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O for the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> analytical finish.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 7.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a 100 mL bottle or centrifuge tube and add 70 mL of P Equilibrating Solution and 3 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) (other weight/volume combinations can be used provided a soil/solution ratio of 1:10 is preserved and the head space in the extracting vessel is about 25% of the total vessel volume). Stopper and shake for 17 h continuously end-over-end (e.g. 15 rpm, 20 cm radius) at 25&#176;C. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm [RCF = 2096 G] or filter (Whatman No.5) to obtain uncontaminated, particulate-free supernatant solutions for P analysis. Contact time between supernatant and soil should not exceed 1 h.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> analytical finish, dilute the cleared soil extracts 1&#43;9 with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and pipette 5 mL aliquots of the diluted extracts and working standards (0 to 10.0 mg P/L) in 50 mL volumetric flasks. Add sufficient 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> to give an approximate volume of 40 mL. Dispense 4.0 mL Mixed Colour Reagent into each flask, make to volume with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and mix.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Maintain a fixed time schedule for these operations including thorough mixing of flask contents. After 30 min, read absorbance at 882 nm in a 10 mm or other suitable cell (colour remains stable for some time beyond 30 min). Alternatively, an automated analytical finish can be used, guided by Method 9F2.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation of PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub></em></h3>
<p class="para">Calculate the amount of freshly sorbed P (<em>Ps</em>) in the soil (mg P/kg) as the difference between the initial amount of P added (=1000 mg P/kg at the specified soil/solution ratio of 1:10) and the amount of P left in the equilibrating solution, expressed as mg P/kg air-dry soil. The latter is calculated by multiplying the final solution P concentration (<em>c</em> in mg P/L) by 10 (because the soil/solution ratio is 1:10).</p>
<p class="indent-para">As PBI is derived from the Freundlich equation for describing the relationship between total P sorbed and final solution P concentration (i.e. the P sorption curve), the total amount of P sorbed by the soil is calculated as the amount of previously sorbed P, plus the amount of freshly sorbed P. The previously sorbed P is estimated as the Colwell-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>) status of the soil. The &#8216;total P sorbed&#8217; for use in calculating PBI is therefore the addition of the Colwell-P to the amount of freshly sorbed P as calculated earlier.</p>
