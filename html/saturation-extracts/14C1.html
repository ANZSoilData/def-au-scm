<p class="para">Measurement of pH of SEs has been helped by the ready availability of pH probes of suitable size, and with sufficient ruggedness to resist abrasion from the soil. <a href="#ch14ref14">Lyons <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> reported a strong linear relationship between pH<sub>/SE</sub> and pH<sub>1:5</sub> (Method 4A1), described by the equation:</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Proceed as for Method 4A1, following determination of EC<sub>/SE</sub>. The SE should receive only slight mechanical stirring during measurement. If stirring is too vigorous atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> can be absorbed, affecting pH<sub>/SE</sub> values as a consequence of chemical reactions. A small combination electrode in a narrow borosilicate glass vial is preferred; plastic vials may cause irregularities due to electrostatic effects.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report pH<sub>/SE</sub> at 25&#176;C, together with method codes for preparing and extracting the SE.</p>
