<p class="para">In common with Method 14G2a, F<sup>&#8211;</sup> and other anions, including Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub>-S, NO<sub>3</sub>-N and PO<sub>4</sub>-P, are included in this analytical suite, described in more detail in Methods 5A3b and 14E2b. The method has high sensitivity (see <a href="#ch14ref07">APHA-AWWA-WEF 2005d</a>) so is suitable for F<sup>&#8211;</sup> determinations, provided high-quality reagents are used. Minimum detectable concentrations of anions are &#8776;0.02&#8211;0.12 mg/L with an injection volume of 100 &#956;L, although detection levels can be reduced by increasing the injection volume. Alternative IC technology, based on chemical suppression of eluent conductivity, is provided as Method 14G2a.</p>
