<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter14sec22"></a>14H1 Soluble bases<sub>/SE</sub> (Ca, Mg, K, Na)</h3>
<p class="para">The soluble bases Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> can be determined by specific elemental analytical finishes such as EDTA titration for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, by FES for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, and sequentially by AAS for all four elements; however, and because the volume of SE can be low (particularly for fine textured soils), the preferred analytical finish and the only one described is based on simultaneous ICPAES. Those who need to use AAS as the analytical finish are referred to <a href="#ch14ref08">APHA-AWWA-WEF (2005e)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The four soluble bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>) are included, along with SO<sub>4</sub>-S and PO<sub>4</sub>-P, in the analytical suite of the ICPAES method, mostly described in Method 14F1. For Na<sup>+</sup> analysis, use an aliquot of the saturation extract free of any sodium hexametaphosphate, as added in Method 14A.</p>

<p class="para">As for Method 5A3a.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>1 M Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)</em></p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_288"></a><em>Calcium Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 5000 mg Ca.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Use commercially available certified solution of 5000 mg Ca/L or weigh 12.486 g of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>; previously dried at 110&#176;C to constant weight) and quantitatively transfer into a 1.0 L volumetric flask using Reagent Water. Cautiously and slowly add sufficient 1 M HCl to completely dissolve the CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Cool and then make to volume with Reagent Water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Magnesium Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 5000 mg Mg.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Use commercially available certified solution of 5000 mg Mg/L or weigh 8.2915 g of magnesium oxide (MgO; previously heated in a muffle furnace at 600 to 700&#176;C), then quantitatively transfer into a 1.0 L volumetric flask using Reagent Water. Cautiously and slowly add sufficient 1 M HCl to completely dissolve the MgO. Cool and then make to volume with Reagent Water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Potassium Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 500 mg K.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 0.9534 g potassium chloride (KCl; previously dried at 110&#176;C for 2 h) in Reagent Water in a 1.0 L volumetric flask and make to volume. Store in a sealed plastic bottle.</p>

<p class="para">1 L contains 10 000 mg Na.</p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 25.421 g sodium chloride (NaCl; previously dried at 110&#176;C for 2 h) in Reagent Water in a 1.0 L volumetric flask and make to volume. Store in a sealed plastic bottle.</p>

<p class="para">Analyse an aliquot of the SE by ICPAES as outlined in Method 14F1, noting that there should be no sodium hexametaphosphate in the extract used for Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report cation (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>) concentrations in SE in mg/L with relevant method codes. Divide mg/L of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> by 20.04, 12.15, 39.1 and 22.99, respectively, to convert each to cmol<sub>c</sub>/L.</p>
