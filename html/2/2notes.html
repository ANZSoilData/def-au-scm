<h3 class="h3">Notes</h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;There is ample evidence that storage of moist soil below 4&#176;C for days to a few weeks &#8211; or at freezing temperatures for longer periods &#8211; minimises biologically induced transformations in nutrient cations and anions. As air-drying brings soils towards a general equilibrium (<a href="#ch02ref09">Etchevers 1986</a>), changes during storage, not due to contamination from the storage container, are likely to be small and slow.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;<a href="#ch02ref23">Piper (1944)</a> recommended crushing rather than grinding but accepted the need to grind heavy-clay soils. The New Zealand designed Rukuhia roller-mill, fitted with a stainless-steel screen (<a href="#ch02ref33">Waters and Sweetman 1955</a>; <a href="#ch02ref21">Metson 1961</a>), is locally popular but performs poorly on many hard-setting Australian soils. Consequently, corn-crackers and stainless steel hammer mills have been successfully adapted for such soils. These mills are efficient, although they have the potential to artificially increase the surface area exposed to <a id="page_16"></a>subsequent chemical reactions (<a href="#ch02ref09">Etchevers 1986</a>). Unlike the Rukuhia soil grinder, grinding and hammer mills require prior removal of gravels and concretions.</p>
