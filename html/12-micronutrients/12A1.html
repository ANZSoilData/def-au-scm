<p class="para">Extracting solutions containing chelating agents such as diethylenetriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) removes micronutrient cations adsorbed on solid phases together with water-soluble constituents. As such, the test may simulate the action of plant roots. Consequently, extraction with DTPA has been used to assess the micronutrient fertility of soils (<a href="#ch12ref25">Lindsay and Norvell 1969a</a>, <a href="#ch12ref27">1978</a>). The test was inferior to dilute CaCl<sub>2</sub> for predicting the availability of soil Cd to a wide range of vegetables (<a href="#ch12ref36">Rayment 1994</a>), while <a href="#ch12ref31">Menzies <em>et al.</em> (2007)</a> report that neutral salt extractants appear to provide the most useful prediction of trace metal phytoavailability.</p>

<p class="indent-para1">This widely used method involves equilibration of air-dry soil for 2 h with extracting solution at a soil/solution ratio of 1:2. Triethanolamine helps buffer the extracting solution close to pH 7.3 and thus restricts dissolution of trace metals from soils of high pH. A pH around 7.3 also favours formation of the Zn-DTPA complex (<a href="#ch12ref26">Lindsay and Norvell 1969b</a>), whereas CaCl<sub>2</sub> acts to suppress carbonate solubility in calcareous soil.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soil preparation, time of extraction and temperature of extraction affect results obtained by empirical methods for heavy metals (<a href="#ch12ref45">Soltanpour <em>et al.</em> 1976</a>, <a href="#ch12ref46">1979</a>; <a href="#ch12ref23">Houba and Novozamsky 1998</a>) so adherence to the described procedure is essential. It is reported that soil grinding and the method of grinding can change the apparent amount of DTPA-heavy metals present (<a href="#ch12ref02">Anon 2000</a>). Soils can be stored in an air-dry condition, however, for several months with no measurable effects on the amount of Zn and Cu extracted.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nowadays, measurement of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn by ICPAES is preferred but AAS provides an acceptable alternative analytical finish for DTPA-extractable heavy metals. <a href="#ch12fig1">Figure 12.1</a> shows the influence of elemental concentrations of DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn on percent robust coefficients of variation (Robust % CVs) from interlaboratory proficiency programs of the ASPAC from 1997&#8211;2007 (<a href="#ch12ref35">e.g. Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch12ref40">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). All 72 soils used were air-dry and finely ground, while laboratories used either ICPAES or AAS for the analytical finish. Grand median robust % CVs were 11, 14, 15 and 23% for grand median soil concentrations of 29.4, 1.42, 0.82 and 46.8 mg/kg for Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe, respectively.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Use an appropriate selection of working standards and determine concentrations of each element (mg/kg) from the appropriate calibration curve, after adjusting for any significant reagent blank. It is important to follow manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations with respect to instrument parameters and wavelength selections: see Notes 2 and 3.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para">3.&#160;&#160;Preferred spectral lines for ICPAES are typically 324.754, 213.856, 257.610 and 259.940 nm for Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe, respectively.
