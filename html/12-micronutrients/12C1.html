<p class="para">Hot water extraction of soil B (<a href="#ch12ref06">Berger and Truog 1939</a>) is widely used to obtain an index of soil B status for plant growth. Unfortunately, the method presents difficulties for routine analysis <a id="page_242"></a>because extracts free of colloidal material are difficult to obtain. <a href="#ch12ref12">Cartwright <em>et al.</em> (1983)</a> proposed 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>-0.05 M mannitol [C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>] as an alternative to hot water extraction because it was suited to analysis by ICPAES. Subsequent research (<a href="#ch12ref01">Aitken <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) has shown that hot 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> is a superior predictor of B deficiency, especially in acid and near neutral soils. The method is highly correlated with hot water-soluble B.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The hot CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable soil B method described is based on refluxing air-dry soil for 10 min with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> at a 1:2 soil/solution ratio. After replacing liquid lost during reflux, extracts are filtered while hot and allowed to cool. In this method, B is determined by an azomethine-H colorimetric procedure based on methods described by <a href="#ch12ref19">Gupta and Stewart (1975)</a>, <a href="#ch12ref17">Gupta (1979)</a>, <a href="#ch12ref15">Gaines and Mitchell (1979)</a>, <a href="#ch12ref34">Parker and Gardner (1981)</a>, and <a href="#ch12ref08">Bloesch (1985)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Colorimetric determination of B is an option when ICPAES is not available. The azomethine-H finish is preferred over other colorimetric procedures for soil B as its colour is developed in aqueous medium. Other colorimetric procedures for determining B, including carminic acid (<a href="#ch12ref21">Hatcher and Wilcox 1950</a>) and curcumin (<a href="#ch12ref22">Hayes and Metcalfe 1962</a>) require concentrated acids or organic solvents. The method takes account of evidence (<a href="#ch12ref08">Bloesch 1985</a>) that time affects the absorbance of a B&#8211;azomethine-H solution, especially at low B concentrations. Brij 35 Wetting Agent is included to improve the flow of solution to the spectrophotometer.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Comparative data between ICPAES and azomethine-H on CaCl<sub>2</sub> extracts of soil (<a href="#ch12ref34">Parker and Gardner 1981</a>; AJ Jeffrey, pers. comm.) suggest that ICPAES will yield slightly lower B values in most cases.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is confirmation for these observations in results reported in ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs. For example, the median values for the azomethine-H method in 2004&#8211;05 (<a href="#ch12ref40">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>) averaged around 9% higher than results obtained by ICPAES, although there were a few samples where the reverse occurred. Continuous relations between soil B concentrations by azomethine-H and robust % CV are unavailable because of limited numbers of laboratory participants for this test in ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs. Method 12C1, however, is consistently less-well performed than its ICPAES alternative (Method 12C2).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Deficiencies of B may occur in soils containing &#60;0.15 mg B/kg by the method described. <a href="#ch12ref11">Bruce and Rayment (1982)</a> have assigned ratings of very low, low, medium, high and very high for hot water-extractable B concentrations of &#60;0.5, 0.5&#8211;1.0, 1.0&#8211;2.0, 2.0&#8211;5.0 and &#62;5.0 mg/B kg.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>0.01 M Calcium Chloride Extracting Solution</em></p>

Wash the charcoal four or five times with 200 mL portions of hot (&#8776;80&#176;C) CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution. Dry the charcoal in an oven at 60&#176;C.</p>

<p class="para1"><a id="page_243"></a><em>Buffer Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 250 g ammonium acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub>) in 500 mL deionised water and adjust solution pH to 5.5 by slowly adding &#8776;100 mL glacial acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) with constant stirring. Add 0.5 mL Brij 35 Wetting Agent and remix.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Azomethine-H Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Azomethine-H is available commercially or may be prepared as described by <a href="#ch12ref42">Shanina <em>et al.</em> (1967)</a>. Dissolve 0.5 g of azomethine-H in &#8776;50 mL of deionised water. Add 1.0 g <em>l</em> ascorbic acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) and warm gently (30&#176;C) to obtain a clear solution. Cool and dilute to 100 mL. The solution remains stable for a week if stored at &#8776;4&#176;C.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Boron Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 250 mg of B.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 1.430 g AR boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>; dried to constant weight in desiccator over anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub>; Note 1) in 0.01 M HCl and make to 1.0 L in a volumetric flask with 0.01 M HCl. Store in a polyethylene or teflon bottle.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Boron Secondary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 20 mg of B.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Pipette 40 mL B Primary Standard into a volumetric flask and make volume to 500 mL with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution. Store in a polyethylene bottle; shelf life is about 4 weeks.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Boron Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Pipette 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mL B Secondary Standard into separate 500 mL volumetric flasks. Dilute to volume with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution. These solutions contain 0.05&#8211;1.0 mg B/L. For a 1:2 soil/solution ratio and equal volumes of standards and extract solutions, these standards contain concentrations of B equivalent to 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 mg B/kg of soil.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Working standards equivalent to 50 mg B/kg may be required when B toxicity in soil is suspected. The extracting solution serves as a blank.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">All glass and plasticware must be washed with dilute (1+4) HCl followed by deionised water before use. Filter papers should be checked for freedom from B contamination. If contaminated, pretreat by washing with hot (&#8776;80&#176;C) CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add 10.0 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) and 20 mL of 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> extracting solution into a B-free flat-bottomed flask or bottle (150 mL). Record weight of each flask plus fresh sample and extracting solution.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next insert a small plastic funnel in the neck of the flask and quickly bring to the boil, then gently reflux for 10 min. Remove the funnel and immediately bring the flask + sample back to its original weight with hot (&#62;80&#176;C) deionised water. Quickly filter the extract through a Whatman No. 40 filter paper into a polyethylene container.</p>
<p class="indent-para">If the hot (&#8776;80&#176;C) extract is not colourless following soil extraction, add approximately 0.1 g activated charcoal to the filtered extract, shake by hand for about 5 min and filter through Whatman No. 42 paper. Repeat the treatment with activated charcoal if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cool then transfer a known suitable aliquot (e.g. 5 mL) into a polyethylene container. Next add 2.0 mL of 0.025 M EDTA solution and 2.0 mL of Buffer Solution. Mix flask contents <a id="page_244"></a>well then add 2.0 mL Azomethine-H solution and shake well. Set aside for a fixed time of 2 h for colour development, away from sunlight. Treat the same size aliquot of each working standard in a similar manner.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Read absorbance of both standards and assays with a spectrophotometer at 420 nm, using identical times for standards and unknowns. Construct a calibration curve (or a regression equation) and determine concentrations of B in soil extracts. Make allowance for any significant reagent calibration blank.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable B (mg B/kg) on an air-dry basis.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;If heated, H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> gradually loses water to initially form metaboric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>2</sub>) and finally the anhydrous oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Accordingly, oven heating must not be used to dry H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#ch12ref04">ASTM 1989</a>).</p>
