<p class="para">This dilute hydrochloric acid method (0.1 M HCl) is suited to use on acidic soils used to grow sugar cane in northern Australia. The basic method was developed by <a href="#ch12ref49">Tucker and Kurtz (1955)</a> and <a href="#ch12ref33">Nelson <em>et al.</em> (1959)</a> and subsequently modified and calibrated to assess Zn deficient soils in coastal Queensland used to grow sugar cane (<a href="#ch12ref41">Reghenzani 1990</a>). As for Method 12A1, it is convenient to analyse each extract for Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe. Dilute HCl is also used as a trace metal extractant on cropping lands, such as in corn-producing areas of the USA (<a href="#ch12ref32">Mokma <em>et al.</em> 1979</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method uses air-dry soil at a 1:10 soil/solution ratio and an extraction time of 1.0 h, with measurement by ICPAES or AAS.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>0.1 M HCl Extracting Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">For each 1.0 L of extracting solution, dilute accurately the equivalent of 10.0 mL analytical grade 10 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to 1.0 L with deionised water. Mix well before use.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Primary Standards (Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe)</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare each as for Method 12A1. 1.0 mL of each of these contains 1.0 mg of Cu and Zn and 5.0 mg of Mn and Fe.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Mixed Secondary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">Take 10.0 mL each of Cu and Zn Primary Standards and 20.0 mL each of Mn and Fe Primary Standards into a small volume of 0.1 M HCl Extracting Solution, mix well and make to 1.0 L in a volumetric flask with 0.1 M HCl Extracting Solution. This solution contains 10 mg/L of both Cu and Zn and 100 mg/L of both Mn and Fe.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Mixed Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Take aliquots of freshly prepared Mixed Secondary Standard as detailed in <a href="#ch12tab5">Table 12.5</a> and make each accurately to 250 mL with 0.1 M HCl Extracting Solution. Actual solution concentrations and equivalent soil contents for a 1:10 soil/extract ratio are also given in <a href="#ch12tab5">Table 12.5</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">A method blank with no soil should be included with each batch of samples.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Weigh 8.0 g of air-dry soil of &#60;2 mm into clean 200 ml extracting bottles/flasks, add 80 mL 0.1 M HCl Extracting Solution, stopper, and as quickly as possible transfer to an end-over-end shaker and extract for exactly 1.0 h. Next filter (Whatman No. 4 paper) or centrifuge the extracts without delay, discarding the first portion, and retain the cleared extracts for analysis. Measure metal concentrations in these filtrates by ICPAES or AAS as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Use an appropriate selection of Working Standards and determine concentrations of each element (mg/kg) from the appropriate calibration curve (or regression equation), after adjusting for any significant reagent blank. It is important to follow manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations with respect to instrument parameters and wavelength selections. Likely wavelengths for ICPAES analysis are Cu = 327.395 nm; Zn = 213.857 nm; Fe = 259.940 nm; and Mn = 257.610 nm. Refer to <a href="#ch12tab4">Table 12.4</a> for typical instrument parameters for analysis by AAS, should this be the only analytical option available.</p>
