<p class="para">This method is identical to 15A1 except that a calculation based on the concentration of soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> present is used to adjust for the apparent level of exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> in the soil. This approximate correction for soluble Na<sup>+</sup> is an alternative to chemical pre-treatment when EC (1:5, soil/water) exceeds &#8776;0.3 dS/m.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Determine the amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> extracted by 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 7.0 (Method 15A1) and the amount of water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> present in the soil (Method 5) at the same soil <a id="page_304"></a>moisture status. Convert mg Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>/kg to cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg by dividing by 354.5. On the assumption that all Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> is associated with NaCl, calculate corrected exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> by subtracting an amount equivalent to the soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>. The measured values for exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> are not affected.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Report exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), expressed on an oven-dry soil basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
