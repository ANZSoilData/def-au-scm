<p class="para">This method is similar to 15D1 except that an automatic extractor is used in place of conventional leaching. It is most useful when leaching impermeable materials, such as sodic and swelling clay soils.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 15.5.</strong> Arrangement of syringes and reservoir used with the Concept Engineering, Inc automatic extractor.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Syringes are 60 mL capacity, made from polypropylene. Use one sample tube, reservoir tube and tared extraction syringe for each sample (<a href="#ch15fig5">Figure 15.5</a>). Rubber or plastic tubing is used to connect syringe barrels. As the sample syringes and reservoirs are not held securely in the extractor, they are prone to dislodgement and must be handled with care. Before use, wash each component that contacts the sample or sample extract initially with water, then with &#8776;1 M HNO<sub>3</sub>, followed by 3 rinses with deionised water in order to limit contamination.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Maintain a separate set of reservoirs and receiving syringes for use with NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, Aqueous Ethanol, and NaCl. If kept separately, the reservoirs need only be rinsed with deionised water after each use. Moreover, receiving syringes used for Aqueous Ethanol and Aqueous Glycerol Wash Solutions require rinsing only, as their contents are discarded.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The barrel and plunger used to draw reagents through the sample syringe will deteriorate quickly if the plunger head is not kept lubricated with silicone lubricant. In addition, inadequate lubrication causes surges of suction as the plunger grips the walls of the barrel and then suddenly releases.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Prepare extraction tubes by placing a Whatman No. 2 filter paper (sized to the internal diameter of the leaching tube) at the bottom of the leaching tube. Fix the filter paper in position using an inert rubber O-ring, also sized to the internal diameter of the leaching tube. Locate these in position using a syringe plunger without its seal.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_320"></a>Weigh 2.50 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) and either 2 g &#8216;celite&#8217; or 5 g acid-washed sand into a clean dry container and mix thoroughly. Transfer the sample into a sample barrel (tared if preferred) using a powder funnel to avoid the sample contacting upper walls of the syringe barrel. Wind the upper two discs of extractor down to the starting position and place leaching tubes in upper disc. To each tube, connect an inverted syringe with its silicone-lubricated plunger inserted in the slot of the stationary disc of the extractor.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Rinse the sides of the sample tube with 60% Aqueous Ethanol &#8211; using a wash bottle &#8211; and fill to the 25 mL graduation mark with the same reagent. Tap the tube to re-level the sample and to remove any entrained air. Place a reservoir on top of the sample tube, start extractor, and extract at a setting of 1 until the Aqueous Ethanol is at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 cm above the sample. Turn off the extractor and add another 25 mL Aqueous Ethanol. Again operate extractor at a setting such that all Aqueous Ethanol is leached through the sample in about 1 h. In a similar manner, leach the soil/sand with 25 mL 20% Aqueous Glycerol and discard the leachates.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following removal of soluble salts, return extractor discs to their starting position. Fill the leaching tube to the 25 mL graduation with 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7.0 Extracting Solution and let stand for 15 min. Tap to relevel the soil/sand and remove any air bubbles.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Replace reservoir on top of sample tube, start extractor and extract at a setting of 1 until the 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7 Extracting Solution is at a depth of 0.5&#8211;1.0 cm above soil/sand. Turn off extractor, add 45 mL of 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc to the reservoir, and extract soil/sand overnight at a setting of 10.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The following morning, switch off extractor and pull the plungers down as far as the extractor will allow. Disconnect receiving syringe from sample tube (leaving rubber connector on sample tube). If tared receiving syringes were used, weigh syringes containing the 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc extract to nearest 0.01 g then retain a portion for determination of exchangeable bases. Alternatively, transfer the NH<sub>4</sub>OAc extracts to flasks calibrated at 125 mL, make to volume with 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7 Extracting Solution and mix thoroughly. Retain for determination of exchangeable bases.</p>
<p class="indent-para">To remove excess 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, return extractor discs to their starting position. Carefully and thoroughly wash inside walls of the leaching tubes with 60% Aqueous Ethanol from a wash bottle, until the liquid reaches the 25 mL graduation mark above the soil/sand. Stir and tap the leaching tube containing the soil/sand and Aqueous Ethanol to dislodge air and let stand for 15&#8211;20 min. Reconnect the reservoirs and receiving syringes used for Aqueous Ethanol and Aqueous Glycerol to the leaching tube and extract at a setting of 1 until level of liquid is 0.5&#8211;1.0 cm above the soil/sand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Turn off extractor, add approximately 45 mL of 60% Aqueous Ethanol to each reservoir, and then re-power and extract at a setting to ensure 45&#8211;90 min of leaching.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When this Aqueous Ethanol extraction is complete, remove inverted syringes and discard the ethanol leachate. Remove reservoirs, wind upper two discs down to starting position and reattach the ethanol syringes. Again, fill the sample tubes to the 25 mL mark with 60% Aqueous Ethanol and replace reservoirs. Repeat the Aqueous Ethanol extraction but omit stirring of samples. When extraction is complete, pull plungers of inverted syringes down as far as possible, remove, and discard contents.</p>
<p class="indent-para">If using direct distillation to determine CEC by Method 15I1, no further leaching of soil is required. For automated colorimetric determination of CEC (15I2) or if using the formol titration (Method 15I4), continue leaching as follows.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Remove Aqueous Ethanol reservoirs and return upper two discs to starting position. Attach a clean set of inverted syringes and fill sample tubes to 25 mL with 1 M NaCl. Place a clean set of reservoirs on sample tubes and extract at a setting of 1 until NaCl is at a depth of 0.5&#8211;1.0 cm above sample. Turn off extractor, add 45 mL of 1 M NaCl to reservoir. Extract sample overnight <a id="page_321"></a>at a setting of 10. Next morning, switch off extractor and pull plungers down as far as possible. Disconnect syringes containing NaCl leachate and transfer contents to 100 mL volumetric flasks. Make to volume with 1 M NaCl and mix thoroughly. Alternatively, if tared syringes were used, the amount of leachate can be determined by weight (nearest 0.01 g).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Determinations and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Analyse for exchangeable bases, guided by Method 15D1. Determine CEC as described in Methods 15I1, 15I2 (preferred) or 15I4.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, respectively, and CEC (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg) on an oven-dry soil basis as for Method 15D1. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to the soil moisture calculation.</p>
