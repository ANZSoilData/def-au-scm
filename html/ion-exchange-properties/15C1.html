<p class="para">This method is preferred for estimates of exchangeable bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) and CEC on alkaline soils containing solid-phase carbonates (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref56">Tucker 1954</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref31">Loveday <em>et al.</em> 1972</a>). This includes calcareous soils from the central west of New South Wales (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref40">Pierce and Morris 2004</a>). It will also provide reliable estimates on soils dominated by colloids with permanent negative surface charges.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method is known to underestimate exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and simultaneously overestimate apparent CEC of neutral and acidic soils that contain variable-charge colloids (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref18">Gillman <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref03">Baker 1984</a>). By virtue of its high ionic strength and strong buffering capacity, however, it does provide a measure of maximum negative charge that can be developed by soils containing variable-charge colloids.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A combination of 60% aqueous ethanol and 20% aqueous glycerol are used initially to remove soluble salts prior to extraction of cations by leaching with alcoholic 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 8.5 (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref57">Tucker 1971</a>) at a soil/solution ratio of 1:20. Exchangeable cations are determined in the leachate using ICPAES (preferred), AAS (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) or FES (Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">CEC is determined after displacing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>) with a solution of 15% KNO<sub>3</sub> plus 6% Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O. This K-Ca solution combination has a multiple capacity for effectively displacing exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> from exchange sites (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref59">Tucker and Beattie 1974a</a>) in addition to excess Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Apparatus and operational procedures for a 2.5 g soil sample (&#60;2 mm air-dry) are described, although larger size soil samples (plus commensurate increases in extractant, etc.) do lessen the possibility of measurement variability. There is a pre-treatment to remove most soluble salts. Carbonate dissolution is suppressed, but gypsum can interfere. If more than 0.6&#8211;0.7% gypsum is present, direct measurement of gypsum is recommended, followed by appropriate adjustments to exchangeable bases and CEC.</p>

<p class="para"><em>Micro Leaching Columns (see <a href="#ch15fig3">Figure 15.3</a>)</em></p>
<p class="para">Leaching columns for 2.5 g soil samples are made from two 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes (e.g. Camlec CP 400C or Kayline CP 10015C) by making a 1 mm hole in the base of each tube. When one tube is placed inside the top of another, it acts as a small reservoir for reagents during leaching. A larger plastic reservoir may be fitted above the reservoir tubes in their rack. A small borosilicate glass wool or cotton wool plug is used to retain soil within the leaching tube.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Micro Leaching Column Rack</em></p>
<p class="para">The rack is constructed from Perspex (or similar) and is about 25 &#215; 20 cm. Each rack has 50 holes which accept the leaching tubes. Holes are placed to allow leaching tubes to protrude into necks of borosilicate glass or plastic bottles, graduated to hold 100 mL. These bottles are held in place by a wooden tray or similar.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Leaching tubes and reservoirs can be capped individually or covered with plastic sheet to reduce evaporation of Extracting Solution during leaching, to prevent contamination and to limit reactions with atmospheric gases.</p>

<p class="para">As indicated in a note associated with <a href="#ch15tab5">Table 15.5</a>, ICPAES may experience difficulties due to the presence of alcohol in the extracting solution presented for analysis. If ICPAES analysis is possible, set up and operate the ICPAES instrument as advised by the manufacturer. Suitable wavelengths are: Ca = 430.25 nm; Mg = 285.21 nm; Na = 588.96 nm; and K = 766.49 nm. Calibrate the instrument using an appropriate range of Working Standard Solutions, guided by examples in <a href="#ch15tab5">Tables 15.5</a> and <a href="#ch15tab6">15.6</a>. The 1:40 soil/extraction ratio can be factored into the calibration on the ICPAES. A calibration blank should also be measured and adjustments made as necessary.</p>
