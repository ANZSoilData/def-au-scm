<p class="para">This procedure is identical to Method 15B1 except that a calculation based on the amount of water soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in the soil is used to adjust for the apparent level of exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> present in the same soil. This approximate correction for soluble Na<sup>+</sup> is an alternative to chemical <a id="page_307"></a>pre-treatment when EC (1:5, soil/water) exceeds &#8776;0.3 dS/m and NaCl is known to be the dominant soluble salt.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Determine exchangeable bases (Method 15B1) and water soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in the soil (Method 5) and continue as described in Method 15A3 and 15B1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Determinations and Reporting</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Determine and report exchangeable cations and CEC (cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), expressed on an oven-dry soil basis. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
