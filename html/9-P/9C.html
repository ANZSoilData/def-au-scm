<p class="para">The method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref58">Olsen <em>et al.</em> (1954)</a> has wide international acceptance as an indicator of soil P fertility. Olsen&#8217;s method is based on extraction of air-dry soil with 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, adjusted to pH 8.5 with NaOH. Soil extraction is for 30 min at a soil/solution ratio of 1:20. There is no prior adjustment of soil pH, or any attempt to remove possible interferences such as arsenate and silicate.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soluble orthophosphate-P in the clarified soil extracts was originally measured using the procedure of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref25">Dickman and Bray (1940)</a>, with activated C (P-free) included during soil extraction to absorb soluble organic matter and organic P. Subsequently, it was demonstrated (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref87">Watanabe and Olsen 1965</a>) that activated C could be excluded from the extraction step when soluble P was measured manually by the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> procedure. This analytical finish is incorporated in the manual and automated methods described. Soil extracts by this method typically have more organic matter colouring than do corresponding extracts obtained using the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> modification. This can be the cause of analytical interference, especially when soils high in OM are acidified as part of the colorimetric reaction.</p>
