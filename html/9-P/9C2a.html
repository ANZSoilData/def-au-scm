<p class="para">The automated colorimetric finish of this method was adapted in Victoria (G Rubenis) from <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref19">Colwell (1965)</a>. The manifold incorporates in-line filtration following neutralisation of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts at ambient temperature with dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The subsequent automated molybdenum-blue colour reaction is similar to <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref54">Murphy and Riley (1958)</a>. The flow chart (<a href="#ch9fig6">Figure 9.6</a>) includes a heating coil.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Users of this automated finish should note that inclusion of a high temperature heating step to accelerate colour development may enhance apparent P values through hydrolysis of organically bound P (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref72">Salt 1968</a>). Use of in-line filtration to remove any flocculent precipitate of organic compounds, following neutralisation of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts, probably limits this effect, which is greatest in acidic soils of high OM content.</p>

<p class="para">Weigh 5.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a 250 mL extracting bottle and add 100 mL Extracting Solution (0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5), stopper and mechanically shake end-over-end for 30 min at 25&#176;C. Quickly centrifuge or filter (Whatman No. 42 - tested P free) to clarify. Alternatively, should the supply of soil be limited, weigh 1.00 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a polypropylene bottle or centrifuge tube. Add 20 mL extracting reagent, stopper or screw to seal, then extract end-over-end 30 min at 25&#176;C. <em>As the amount of P extracted is time dependent, it is important to add the extractant and to time the commencement of shaking without delay. Accordingly, use equipment capable of mass production or limit batch sizes to around 30&#8211;50 samples.</em> Include two reagent blanks and one laboratory control sample per 20&#8211;30 samples through the same extraction procedure and subsequent analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Quickly filter (e.g. Advantec Toyo 5C filter paper) or centrifuge into/in vials or tubes. Analyse on the day of extraction: refer to Notes 1&#8211;3 of Method 9C1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ensure individual components of the Olsen-P continuous segmented flow manifold are connected as detailed on the flow sheet (<a href="#ch9fig6">Figure 9.6</a>); instrument selections and settings should be in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. The analyst should be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method.</p>
<p class="indent-para">&#8216;Condition&#8217; the manifold before use and make occasional checks to ensure there is just sufficient acidity to prevent significant interference from silicates or from self-reduction of molybdate ions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine concentrations of P in the soil extracts directly (mg P/kg) from calibration standards run on commencement, after at least every 30&#8211;50 soil extracts, and on completion. Use the 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5 Extracting Solution as the wash solution and to dilute soil extracts of high P concentrations. Same-day measurement is preferred to limit the possibility of chemical and/or biological change.</p>
