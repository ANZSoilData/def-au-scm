<p class="para">Sorption curves can be established by the addition to soil of graded amounts of P in 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 0.02 M potassium chloride (KCl). The former solution is preferred here because: (i) it has been more commonly used in Australia and elsewhere (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref61">Ozanne and Shaw 1967</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref28">Fox 1978</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref66">Probert 1983</a>), and (ii) it is less aggressive than KCl. The supernatant P concentration (C) is measured following an equilibration period of 17 h. Calculation of the amount of P sorbed can then be made.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The P sorption curve for a given soil is constructed by plotting P sorbed against log<sub>10</sub>C for each addition of P. The plot is usually linear for most soils up to a supernatant P concentration of at least 0.1 mg P/L.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The equilibrium P concentration (EPC) is derived by extrapolation of the P sorption curve to the point when P sorbed = 0 (zero). The PBC, which is a reflection of the P sorbing or P fixing ability of the soil, corresponds to the slope of the regression line fitted to the P sorption curve. The higher the slope the higher the PBC.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_195"></a>Manual and automated options for measuring the supernatant P concentration are included, both based on the reagents of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>. It is chemically challenging to include soils of widely different PBCs in the same batch of samples, unless there is prior knowledge sufficient to &#8216;tailor&#8217; the solution concentrations of the graded P additions.</p>
