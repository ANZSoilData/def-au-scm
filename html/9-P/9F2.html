<p class="para">Basic components of this method (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1988</a>) involve extraction for 18 h by 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> at a 1:5 soil/solution ratio, with a colorimetric finish based on the method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The automated, segmented-flow colorimetric finish described that uses AutoAnalyzer I/II technology is based on <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref86">Warrell and Moody (1984)</a>. Microbore or FIA are appropriate alternatives, ideally without any heating above 37&#176;C to speed colour development. Irrespective of the technology employed, the analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method. Whichever technology is used, the results obtained should be close to those obtained by Method 9F1. See preamble to Method 9F1 for further information on this soil P test.</p>

<p class="para">Prepare particulate-free soil extracts as described in Method 9F1 and transfer to clean dry tubes for automated colorimetric analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ensure individual components of the continuous flow analyser system are connected as detailed on the flow sheet (<a href="#ch9fig10">Figure 9.10</a>) and are in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. &#8216;Condition&#8217; the manifold before use and check instrument settings, then run calibration standards on commencement, after at least every 30 soil extracts and on completion. Prepare a calibration curve from the P Working Standards and interpolate concentrations of samples from the graph (or from a regression equation).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="para">Convert P concentrations in sample solutions from mg P/L to &#956;g P/kg of soil by multiplying by 5000 (the soil/solution ratio is 1:5 for this extraction).</p>
