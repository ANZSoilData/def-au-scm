<p class="para">Dilute (0.005&#8211;0.01 M) CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable P is highly correlated with soil solution P concentration (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1988</a>), and therefore favours the intensity component of labile P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Calcium chloride-extractable P (0.01 M) was the best predictor of grain yield response by soybeans to P on a wide range of soil types in south-eastern and central Queensland (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref52">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>). It can also predict the P fertiliser requirements of subterranean clover (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref23">Dear <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>). The extractant at 0.005 M is also useful for identifying soils with an elevated risk of P loss to the water environment: see Method 9K for more details.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method described (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1988</a>) involves extraction for 18 h by 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> at a 1:5 soil/solution ratio, with a colorimetric finish based on the method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>. Because of the small amounts of P extracted by this method, results are commonly expressed as &#956;g P/kg, rather than mg P/kg.</p>

<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_180"></a>Dilute 50.0 mL P Primary Standard, with constant stirring, to 500 mL with 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. This solution should be freshly prepared each time working standards are made.</p>

<p class="para">Add 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 10.0 mL P Secondary Standard to separate 500 mL volumetric flasks and make to volume with 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. These working standards contain P concentrations of 0, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.10 mg P/L.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Wash glassware and filter papers used for filtration and colorimetric analysis before use with dilute (1&#43;4) HCl then rinse and dry. Weigh 10.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 100 mL centrifuge tubes or suitable extraction bottles. Dispense 50.0 mL of 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> Extracting Solution into each tube. Add 2 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to each container, stopper, and shake end-over-end for 18 h at 25&#176;C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Centrifuge or filter, and pipette identical aliquots (usually 25&#8211;40 mL) of clear soil extracts and working standards to 50 mL volumetric flasks, and add sufficient 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> to give an approximate volume of 40 mL. Dispense 4.0 mL Mixed Colour Reagent into each flask, make to volume with 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and mix. Maintain a fixed time schedule for these operations including thorough mixing of flask contents. After 30 min read absorbance at 882 nm in a 50 mm or other suitable cell (colour remains stable for some time beyond 30 min). Prepare a calibration curve of absorbance against concentration of standards. Interpolate the P concentrations of the sample solutions from the graph (or from a regression equation).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="para">Convert P concentrations in sample solutions from mg P/L to &#956;g P/kg of soil by multiplying by 5000 (the soil/solution ratio is 1:5 for this extraction).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable P (&#956;g P/kg) on an air-dry basis.</p>
