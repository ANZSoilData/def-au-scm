<p class="para">This method is equivalent to Method 9J1 except that an automated finish (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref86">Warrell and Moody 1984</a>) based on the colorimetric procedure of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> is used to obtain the concentration of P remaining in solution following equilibration with soil. While AutoAnalyzer I/II technology is described, microbore or FIA are appropriate alternatives, ideally without any heating beyond 37&#176;C to speed colour development. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method. Whichever technology is used, the results obtained should be close to those obtained by Method 9J1.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Ensure individual components of the continuous flow analyser system for the determination of P are connected as detailed on the segmented flow manifold for calcium chloride-extractable P (<a href="#ch9fig10">Figure 9.10</a>), except that 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> should replace 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> as the sampler wash solution; instrument selections and settings should be in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.
