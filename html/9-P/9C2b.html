<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec12"></a>9C2b Olsen-extractable P (Olsen-P) &#8211; automated colour, FIA</h3>
<p class="para">This method is based on the P extraction method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref58">Olsen <em>et al.</em> (1954)</a>. It is similar to that used by commercial laboratories to produce soil P test values for New Zealand soils (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref21">Cornforth 1980</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The determination of P in clarified extracts is based on the molybdenum-blue method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> using FIA. Orthophosphate reacts with ammonium molybdate and potassium antimony tartrate under acidic conditions. The complex formed is then reduced with ascorbic acid, with absorbance measured at 882 nm.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A silicate concentration of over 100 mg/L would be needed to produce a positive 0.015 mg P/L error. If such possibility is suspected, use the silicate solution specified and refer to Note 2 of Method 9B2.</p>

There may be a water quality problem if this mixed solution should become cloudy, in which case, use only distilled water or deionised water known not to contain organic impurities.

<p class="para1"><em>Olsen-P FIA Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Pipette 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mL aliquots of Olsen-P Primary Standard into 100 mL volumetric flasks and make to volume with 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5 Extracting Solution.

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 5.0 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a 250 mL extracting bottle and add 100 mL Extracting Solution (0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5), stopper and mechanically shake end-over-end for 30 min at 25&#176;C; see Note 1 of Method 9C2a. Quickly centrifuge or filter (Whatman No. 42 &#8211; tested P-free) to clarify. Alternatively, should the supply of soil be limited, weigh 1.00 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a polypropylene bottle or centrifuge tube. Add 20 mL extracting reagent, stopper or screw to seal, then extract end-over-end for 30 min at 25&#176;C. <em>As the amount of P extracted is time dependent, it is important to add the extractant and to time the commencement of shaking without delay. Accordingly, use equipment capable of mass production or limit batch sizes to around 30&#8211;50 samples.</em> Include two reagent blanks and one laboratory control sample for each batch of 30&#8211;50 samples through the same extraction procedure and subsequent analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_173"></a>Quickly filter (e.g. Advantec Toyo 5C filter paper) or centrifuge into/in vials or tubes. Analyse on the day of extraction: refer to Notes 2 and 3 of Method 9C1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Set up the FIA instrumentation along the lines shown in <a href="#ch9fig7">Figure 9.7</a>. Ensure the dialyser is operating correctly by checking entry and exit tubes are connected correctly. Make occasional checks to ensure there is just sufficient acidity to prevent significant interference from silicates or from self-reduction of molybdate ions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Switch on the computer, load the software, prepare sample table and load sampler. Pump deionised water through all reagent lines and check for leaks and smooth flow. When all is OK, switch to reagents and allow system to equilibrate for a few minutes, then commence to run standards and samples.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine concentrations of P in the soil extracts directly (mg P/kg) from calibration standards run on commencement, after at least every 30&#8211;50 soil extracts, and on completion. Use the 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5 Extracting Solution as the wash solution and to dilute soil extracts of high P concentrations. Same-day measurement is preferred to limit the possibility of chemical and/or biological change.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report Olsen-extractable P (mg P/kg) on an air-dry soil basis.</p>
