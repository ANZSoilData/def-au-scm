<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec10"></a>9C1 Olsen-extractable P (Olsen-P) &#8211; manual colour</h3>
<p class="para">By virtue of its relatively short extraction time and narrow soil/solution ratio, Olsen-P reflects the intensity component of soil P, rather than the quantity component favoured by the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> modification (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref88">White and Haydock 1967</a>). Results for any given soil are almost always lower than corresponding values obtained for the Colwell-P test.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Extracting Solution &#8211; 0.5 M Sodium Bicarbonate at pH 8.5</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 9B1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Reagent A</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 12.0 g ammonium molybdate [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O] in 250 mL distilled water. Separately dissolve 0.2908 g potassium antimony tartrate (KSbO.C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in 100 mL distilled water. Add both of the dissolved reagents, while stirring, to 1 L of cool 2.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (139 mL 18 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to 1 L with distilled water). Mix thoroughly and make volume to 2 L with distilled water. This reagent remains stable for long periods when stored in borosilicate glass in a dark, cool place. (See Note 1 of Method 9B2.)</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Colour Reagent B</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 1.056 g of <em>l</em>-ascorbic acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in 200 mL of Reagent A and mix well. Prepare as required as this reagent does not keep for &#62;24 h.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>p-Nitrophenol Indicator</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 9A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>2.5 M Sulfuric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 100.0 mg of P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 0.2197 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; previously dried at 130&#176;C for 2 h) in 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5 Extracting Solution and make to 500 mL in a volumetric flask. Add 2 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to suppress biological activity. Store solution in <a id="page_168"></a>borosilicate glass, preferably cool (&#8776;4&#176;C) and in the dark, where it should remain stable for at least 6 months.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Secondary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 20.0 mg of P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Take 100 mL P Primary Standard and dilute to 500 mL in a volumetric flask with Extracting Solution (0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5). This standard should be freshly prepared each time working standards are required.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Add 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 37.5 and 50 mL of P Secondary Standard to separate 500 mL volumetric flasks. Dilute to 500 mL with Extracting Solution to give P concentrations in solution ranging from 0&#8211;2.0 mg P/L. For a 1:20 soil/solution ratio, these standards contain soil concentrations equivalent to 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40 mg P/kg.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 5.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a 250 mL extracting bottle and add 100 mL Extracting Solution (0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5), stopper and mechanically shake end-over-end for 30 min at 25&#176;C; see Notes 1&#8211;3. Quickly centrifuge or filter (Whatman No. 42 &#8211; tested P free) to clarify.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Pipette a known aliquot of the particle-free extract &#8211; usually 5.0 mL &#8211; into a 25 mL volumetric flask. Add 1 drop of p-nitrophenol indicator and acidify carefully to pH 5.0 with 2.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Dilute to 20 mL with deionised water, mix, add 4.0 mL of Colour Reagent B, make volume to 25 mL with deionised water and mix well. Concurrently with the samples, take identical volumes (usually 5.0 mL) of a range of P Working Standards and treat in a similar manner to soil extracts.</p>
<p class="indent-para">After 30 min, measure absorbance (882 nm) of samples, standards, and a reagent blank against deionised water as a reference. The absorbance values remain stable for up to 24 h. Prepare a calibration curve of absorbance against concentrations of standards. Read concentrations of samples and reagent blanks from the graph or from an equivalent regression equation. Same-day measurement following acidification is preferred to limit the possibility of chemical and/or biological change.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="center-paras">Olsen-extractable P = [sample value &#8211; reagent blank] (mg P/kg)</p>
<p class="para">Report Olsen-extractable P (mg P/kg) on an air-dry soil basis.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Notes</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;One teaspoon of P-free carbon black (e.g. Darco G-60 or equivalent) can be added prior to soil extraction if there is concern that coloured organic matter and/or organic P could interfere during development of the molybdenum-blue complex.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Should there be concern that biological activity during soil extraction/analysis could affect P concentrations, add 2 drops of thymol solution (20% w/v) immediately following addition of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5 Extracting Solution to the soil. Thymol solution may also be added to the P Working Standards.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">3.&#160;&#160;If wetting agents/detergents are used for any purpose, including cleaning of apparatus, only those known to be P-free should be used.</p>
