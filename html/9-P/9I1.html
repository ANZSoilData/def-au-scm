<p class="para">A standardised P sorption measurement, which embraces adsorption as well as precipitation reactions, can reveal useful information at relatively low analytical cost. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref05">Bache and Williams (1971)</a> introduced the concept of a P index, based on one addition of 150 mg P/100 g soil in &#8776;0.02 M potassium chloride (KCl) in the ratio 1:20 g/mL.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In Australia, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref35">Holford and Cullis (1985)</a> demonstrated that a one-addition concentration of 248 mg P/kg provided a useful &#8216;P index&#8217; for wheat-growing soils of NSW. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> (1988)</a> subsequently preferred a one-addition concentration range between 60 and 248 mg P/kg. The single-addition for this method is equivalent to 150 mg P/kg soil as potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) contained in an Extracting Solution of 0.02 M KCl at a soil/solution ratio of 1:20 for 17 h. Residual H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in the equilibrating solution is determined by the method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>. The P sorption index is then calculated. It is typically reported on an air-dry basis without the inclusion of units [(mg/kg)/(log<sub>10</sub> &#956;g/L)].</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Phosphate Equilibrating Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 7.50 mg of P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 0.1648 g potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; previously dried at 130&#176;C for 2 h) in deionised water. Also dissolve 7.455 g KCl in deionised water. Mix, and make volume to 5.0 L.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>0.02 M Potassium Chloride</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 1.49 g KCl in deionised water and make volume to 1.0 L.</p>

<p class="para">As for Method 9A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Secondary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 4 mg of P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Pipette 8 mL P Primary Standard into a 100 mL volumetric flask, containing some 0.02 M KCl. Mix and dilute to volume with 0.02 M KCl.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Wash glassware and filter papers used for filtration and colorimetric analysis before use with dilute (1&#43;4) HCl then rinse and dry.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Weigh 2.50 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a 250 mL flask or bottle and add 50 mL P equilibrating solution and 3 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>). Stopper and shake for 17 h continuously at 25&#176;C on a slow end-over-end shaker. Centrifuge or filter the extract through a Whatman No. 42 filter paper. Pipette 2 mL clear extract (weakly sorptive soil) or up to 10 mL clear extract (strongly sorptive soil) into a 100 mL volumetric flask. To each add &#8776;60 mL 0.02 M KCl, mix, <a id="page_188"></a>then add 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent, dilute to volume with 0.02 M KCl and mix well. Treat a reagent blank in a similar way.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Concurrently take 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mL aliquots of P Secondary Standard in 100 mL volumetric flasks containing &#8776;60 mL of 0.02 M KCl.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent, dilute to volume with 0.02 M KCl and mix well. Phosphorus concentrations are given in <a href="#ch9tab6">Table 9.6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">After 30 min (colour is stable for some time beyond this) measure absorbance at 882 nm (preferred) or 720 nm of samples, standards and reagent blank, against water as a reference.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare a calibration curve (or regression equation) of absorbance against concentration of the working standards. Read final concentrations of P in the soil extracts as &#956;g P/L to give the supernatant P concentration &#8216;C&#8217; and also as mg P/kg soil, required for the determination of P sorbed &#8216;X&#8217;. Make appropriate adjustments if dilutions of soil extracts or working standards differ from those in <a href="#ch9tab6">Table 9.6</a>, and subtract the reagent blank.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="para">The preferred units to express the P sorption index (X/log<sub>10</sub>C) are mg P sorbed/kg soil for &#8216;X&#8217; and &#956;g P/L for concentration in the final supernatant solution, &#8216;C&#8217;, since they give a convenient range of values for the P sorption index of most soils. To calculate:</p>
<p class="indent-para">Subtract the supernatant P concentration, expressed as mg P/kg soil from 150 mg P/kg soil (the concentration of P initially added). The resultant gives P sorbed &#8216;X&#8217;.</p>
