<p class="para">This method is very similar to Method 9I2a, apart from its analytical finish. This is undertaken by the colorimetric vanadate finish, which is suited to higher solution P concentrations than is the Murphy and Riley colorimetric finish.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution, the Phosphate Equilibrating Solution, and the P Primary Standard (1L contains 100 mg P) are identical to those for Method 9I2a.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Nitric-Vanadomolybdate Reagent</em></h3>
<p class="para">Vanadium molybdate solution: Dissolve 40.00 g ammonium molybdate and 2.00 g ammonium (meta) vanadate in 1.5 L warm distilled (preferred) or deionised water (temperature should not exceed 50&#176;C). Add 280 mL nitric acid (sg. 1.20, see below) and make to 2.0 L with water. See Note 1 of Method 9B2 on the reason for preferring distilled water.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Nitric Acid; sg. 1.20</em></h3>
<p class="para">Dilute 780 mL concentrated nitric acid (sg. 1.42) to 2.0 L with distilled or deionised water.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Phosphorus Working Standards</em></h3>
<p class="para">Add appropriate aliquots of the P Primary Standard to 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> to achieve final working standards ranging from 0 to 100 mg P/L in 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 7.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 100 mL bottle or centrifuge tube and add 70 mL of P Equilibrating Solution and 3 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) and proceed with soil equilibration as for Method 9I2a.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For the vanadomolybdate analytical finish, pipette 10 mL aliquots of cleared soil extracts (as per Method 9I2a) and Working Standards (0 to 100 mg P/L) into 100 mL volumetric flasks and add sufficient 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> to give an approximate volume of 60 mL. Next add 25 mL of vanadomolybdate solution, make to volume with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and mix. After 60 min, read absorbance at 400 nm in a 10 mm or other suitable cell (colour remains stable for some time).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Calculation of PBI+ColP</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Proceed as for Method 9I2a (and Note 1 for that method).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report PBI+ColP on an air-dry (40&#176;C) basis.</p>
