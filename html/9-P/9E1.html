<p class="para">The original manual colorimetric &#8216;finish&#8217; for Bray 1-P of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref12">Bray and Kurtz (1945)</a> was that of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref25">Dickman and Bray (1940)</a>. The analytical &#8216;finish&#8217; described is based on <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>, which is known to be superior to the original.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 7.14 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL flask or bottle, and add 50 mL 0.03 M NH<sub>4</sub>F in 0.025 M HCl Extracting Solution. Stopper and shake for 60 s at 25&#176;C. (Time this extraction accurately.) Immediately centrifuge or filter (Whatman No. 42) to obtain particle-free soil extracts. Pipette 10 mL of this extract into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Add 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent and dilute to 100 mL with deionised water on the day of extraction.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Concurrently, take 0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0 mL aliquots of the P Secondary Standard in 100 mL volumetric flasks. Add 10 mL extractant, 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent, and dilute each standard to 100 mL with deionised water and mix well. These working standards contain 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mg P/L. For a 1:7 soil/solution ratio and a 10 mL aliquot diluted to 100 mL, these working standards contain soil concentrations of 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 mg P/kg.</p>
<p class="indent-para">After 30 min (colour is stable for 24 h) measure absorbance at 882 nm (preferred) or 720 nm of the samples, standards, and a reagent blank against deionised water as reference. Prepare a calibration curve (or equivalent) of absorbance against concentration of the working standards. Interpolate the concentrations of the samples and reagent blank from the graph (or alternative). Dilute soil extracts of high P concentrations with 0.03 M NH<sub>4</sub>F in 0.025M HCl Extracting Solution.</p>
