<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec19"></a>9G1 Acid-extractable P (BSES-P) &#8211; manual colour</h3>
<p class="para">This method, supported by field-based correlations, was initially developed to predict the P responsiveness of soils used for sugar cane in east-coastal Queensland (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref39">Kerr and von Stieglitz 1938</a>). Colloquially termed BSES-P, this test has also been used to assess the &#8216;available&#8217; P status of many surface soils in Queensland, including for land use surveys (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref65">Powell 1977</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 9.10.</strong> A continuous, segmented flow sheet (AutoAnalyzer I/II technology) for calcium chloride-extractable P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soil extracts for analysis are obtained by shaking air-dry soil of &#60;2 mm at a ratio of 1:200 with 0.005 M sulfuric acid for 16 h, according to the method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref39">Kerr and von Stieglitz (1938)</a>. Orthophosphate in the cleared extract is determined manually by the colorimetric method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref82">Truog and Meyer (1929)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref81">Truog (1930)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Because of the extended period of soil/extractant contact and wide soil/solution ratio, the method favours the quantity component of the labile pool of soil P. As it also favours extraction of Ca-bound P, many forms of which are not available to plants, the test can overestimate P availability, especially in soils containing basic forms of these minerals, such as hydroxyapatite.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is no prior adjustment of soil pH, or any attempt to remove possible interferences.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Extraction Solution &#8211; 0.005 M Sulfuric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">Initially prepare a stock solution of 2.0 M sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) by diluting 111.1 mL H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (18 M) to 1.0 L with deionised water. Standardise a known dilution of this stock solution (e.g. &#8776;0.05 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in CO<sub>2</sub>-free deionised water) against a known weight of sodium borate decahydrate (Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O) in a similar manner to that described in Method 7A1. Alternatively, standardise using a purchased sodium hydroxide solution of known concentration, with methyl red as indicator.</p>
<p class="indent-para">If the stock solution is exactly 2.0 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, dilute 100 mL of this to 40 L with deionised water. This solution of 0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is stable for long periods if kept free of dust and chemical contamination. Equilibrate to 25&#176;C prior to use.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Ammonium Molybdate &#8211; Sulfuric Acid Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 25.0 g ammonium molybdate [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O] in 200 mL distilled (preferred) or deionised water. Separately dilute 280 mL of 18 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> by adding carefully to distilled or deionised water. Cool and make volume to 800 mL. Now add slowly the cool molybdate <a id="page_183"></a>solution to the dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and allow to return to room temperature before use. See Note 1 of Method 9B2 on the reason for preferring distilled water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Stannous Chloride Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 25.0 g stannous chloride (SnCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) in 100 mL 10 M HCl and dilute to 1.0 L with distilled water. Store in a glass bottle fitted with a delivery cock near the bottom so as to provide the solution in drops. Protect the solution from air by covering with paraffin oil.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 9A2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Secondary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 5.0 mg of P</p>
<p class="indent-para">Take 50 mL P Primary Standard and dilute with Extracting Solution (0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) to 500 mL in a volumetric flask. This solution should be freshly prepared each time working standards are made.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Phosphorus Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Add 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0 and 60.0 mL of P Secondary Standard to separate 500 mL volumetric flasks. When diluted to 500 mL with Extracting Solution (0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), these solutions contain 0.01, 0.025 &#8230; 0.60 mg P/L. For a 1:200 soil/solution ratio these standards contain P equivalent to soil concentrations of 2.0, 5.0 &#8230; 120 mg P/kg.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1.0 &#177; 0.01 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL extracting bottles and add 200 mL Extracting Solution (0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), stopper and mechanically shake end-over-end for 16 h at 25&#176;C. Centrifuge or filter (No. 42 or 50 paper), discarding the first portion.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Pipette 20 mL aliquots of the particle-free extracts, standards, and a blank into separate 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Add 1.0 mL of Ammonium Molybdate-Sulfuric Acid Solution and mix thoroughly. Add 4 drops of Stannous Chloride Solution, shake thoroughly and allow colour to develop for at least 5 min.</p>
<p class="indent-para">After a fixed time interval between 5 min and a maximum of 20 min, measure absorbance of samples, standards and the blank (0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> plus colour reagents) at 660 nm. Prepare a calibration curve of absorbance against concentration of the standards and read concentrations of samples and blank.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute extracts of high P concentrations with 0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> Extracting Solution.</p>
