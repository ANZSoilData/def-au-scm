<p class="para">Three methods for TP, one based on X-ray fluorescence (XRF), the second based on fusion with sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), and a third obtained following Kjeldahl digestion, are described. In addition, <a href="chapter17.html#chapter17">Chapter 17</a> includes methods that involve digestion with strong acids that, like Kjeldahl P, provide &#8216;pseudo-totals&#8217; lower than the true value. Proficiency testing services should take account of likely differences between methods before &#8216;pooling&#8217; results during the assessment of measurement performance for TP.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Digestion procedures involving use of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and perchloric acid (HClO<sub>4</sub>) have been avoided due to safety concerns in some laboratories. One such method uses boiling hydrochloric acid (HCl) following a pre-ignition treatment known to reduce the solubility of soil-titanium compounds to about 10&#8211;20% of those of &#8216;paired&#8217; non-ignited soils. That method (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref07">Beckwith and Little 1963</a>) uses 70% HClO<sub>4</sub> to expel excess HCl.</p>
