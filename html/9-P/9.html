<h2 class="h2a">Phosphorus</h2>
<p class="para">Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient, mostly obtained by plants from soil. Unfortunately, few soils are able to continuously meet the P requirements of productive plants, without inputs of phosphatic fertilisers, manures, biosolids and the like. Great progress towards understanding the chemistry and biochemistry of soil and plant P has helped answer questions on the extent of soil P reserves and whether or not a response by plants to P applications might be expected. This chapter draws on that understanding, noting the four key P supply factors are quantity, intensity, rate and capacity.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The most abundant P mineral is apatite [Ca<sub>5</sub>(F, Cl, OH)(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>], which has a structure that tolerates numerous cationic replacements for Ca and several anionic replacements for phosphate. In addition, P often occurs in silicate minerals due to isomorphous replacement of Si<sup>4&#43;</sup> by P<sup>5&#43;</sup> in silicate (SiO<sub>4</sub>) tetrahedra. The low solubilities of orthophosphates of Ca, Fe, Al and Pb greatly influence the reactivity of P in natural systems and soils. Free PO<sub>4</sub> ions in soils from natural weathering and from fertilisers are rapidly adsorbed onto the surface of most soils via several mechanisms that commonly involve chemical reactions with Fe, Al, Ca and Mg (see <a href="#ch9tab1">Table 9.1</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref83">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). P is non-volatile at normal soil temperatures, while the likelihood of P leaching is low in soils with a capacity to remove it from soil solution by fixation or precipitation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Total Soil P</em></h3>
<p class="para">Total P (TP) concentrations in Australian soils are low by world standards (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref51">Moody and Bolland 1999</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref04">Anon 2001</a>). This is supported by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref57">Norrish and Rosser (1983)</a>, who provided summary data on TP concentrations in a selection of Australian soils. Median concentrations of 0.035 and 0.025% P were obtained from their tabulated data for typical surface and sub-soils, respectively. The concentration range for surface soils was 0.011&#8211;0.169% P. Modelled estimates by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref04">Anon (2001)</a> found the majority of Australian soils associated with all types of land uses, with the exception of irrigated cropping soils, contained &#60;0.02% of TP. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref04">Anon (2001)</a> estimated 16% of horticultural soils contained &#62;0.05% P, with lesser percentages associated with all other land uses. The median concentration of TP for 11 surface horizons of New Zealand reference soils (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref85">Vortman 1980</a>) was 0.049% P, with a range of 0.012&#8211;0.233% P, almost always with lower concentrations in sub-soils.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 9.1.</strong> Continuous relationships between concentrations of total soil P (pooled methods) vs median robust % coefficients of variations (CVs), derived from 1997&#8211;2007 ASPAC Proficiency Testing Programs.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Chemists quickly established that TP concentrations rarely provided a reliable guide to whether or not plants would respond to applications of P. Measurement of TP, however, is highly relevant to mass-balance studies and the like.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Much of the TP is immobilised in forms not readily available to plants, such as organically bound P and insoluble mineral P. Whether natural to the soil or supplied from external sources, rocks and associated minerals are the primary source of this nutrient. Accordingly, methods to quantify TP derive from those developed for the analysis of silicate rocks (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref47">Metson 1961</a>). These need to function from close to zero concentrations to (less commonly) upwards of 1% P. For example, the average total P concentrations in basaltic rock and granites worldwide are around 0.14 and 0.07% P, respectively (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref83">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">ASPAC has data on TP covering the period 1997&#8211;2007 (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref62">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref70">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). The relationship between TP concentrations on robust coefficients of determination (CVs) shown in <a href="#ch9fig1">Figure 9.1</a> was derived from 72 samples, which ranged in concentration from 0.006&#8211;0.312% P, with a median of 0.039% P.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Extractable P</em></h3>
<p class="para">The lack of success of TP as a diagnostic test stimulated an ongoing quest to quantify and understand what affects and controls the supply of soil P, including extractions to assess readily available fractions. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref26">Dyer (1894)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref71">Russell and Prescott (1916&#8211;1917)</a> provided early insights, while more recent assessments with a focus on soil test methodology have been published (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref75">Sibbesen 1983</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref60">O&#8217;Halloran 1993</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref40">Kuo 1996</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref51">Moody and Bolland 1999</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The amount of P contained in the soil solution and the rate of P diffusion to the plant root surface affects the supply of soil P to plants (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref49">Moody 1985</a>). Additional factors are soil parent material, weathering processes, soil moisture status, vegetation, and historical land management practices. Not surprisingly, no single extracting reagent for &#8216;available&#8217; or &#8216;extractable&#8217; soil P has been formulated that can mimic the uptake of P by plant roots across the growing season (e.g. <a id="page_149"></a><a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref79">Thomas and Peaslee 1973</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref51">Moody and Bolland 1999</a>). Nevertheless, efforts to improve the effectiveness of extractable soil P tests are ongoing. One of these, beyond the scope of this chapter, is diffusive gradients in thin films technology (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref91">Zhang 2003</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref46">Menzies <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Many different extractants for soil P (and sometimes concurrently for other nutrients) have resulted: see Table 7 of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref32">Hedley <em>et al.</em> (1995)</a>. Criteria related to adoption include a good and robust correlation or association between analytical values and other attributes, such as plant yield or fertiliser requirement. In addition, the method also needs to be safe and relatively cheap to apply. A link between extractant chemistry and nutrient uptake by plant roots is an attractive additional criterion for adoption, provided the earlier-mentioned criteria are also met. In practice, the defined method should be followed closely, as changes to the specified extractant, the soil/solution ratio, analytical finish, and temperature of extraction can affect the results obtained. For example, JD Colwell (unpublished data) did indicate that the Colwell-P test performed at 20&#176;C could be expected to yield slightly lower results than obtained for the same soils at 25&#176;C. Specifically, soils testing 5 and 25 mg P/kg at 20&#176;C increased to 5.3 and 25.8 mg P/kg at 25&#176;C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Across Australasia, several empirical extractants for soil P are used or are suitable for use by soil testing services. Those in wide use or justified from results of recent research include the bicarbonate extractions of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref58">Olsen <em>et al.</em> (1954)</a>, lactate-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref36a">Holford <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>), fluoride-extractable P (Bray 1; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref12">Bray and Kurtz 1945</a>), dilute CaCl<sub>2</sub>- extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref52">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref23">Dear <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>), and acid-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref39">Kerr and von Stieglitz 1938</a>). Manual, and in most cases, automated colorimetric procedures for measuring the PO<sub>4</sub>-P present in the relevant soil extracts are included in this chapter. Details of the Mehlich 3-extractable P test (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref45">Mehlich 1984</a>), a popular, universal soil test (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref08">Benton Jones 1990</a>) used widely in North America, are included as Method 18F.</p>
<p class="indent-para">ASPAC, via its Australasian soil inter-laboratory proficiency programs (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref62">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref70">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>), has compiled method performance data on three extractable P tests (Colwell, Olsen, Bray 1) for over a decade. <a href="#ch9fig2">Figure 9.2</a> shows the continuous relationships between median robust co-efficients of variations (robust % CVs) (after the removal of errant data) and corresponding extractable P concentrations for 72 samples for the period 1997&#8211;2007. Although considerable measurement uncertainty exists, the Colwell-P and Olsen-P tests were consistently better performed than was the Bray 1-P test.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>P fixation/sorption</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soils have vastly different P sorption properties, sufficient to affect the rates of fertiliser needed to overcome P deficiency (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref33">Helyar and Spencer 1977</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref36">Holford and Mattingly 1979</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref41">Kuo <em>et al.</em> 1988</a>). Further, soils may be grouped on the basis of their ability to remove and/or retain P from aqueous solution. The Japanese have long used a P-sorption coefficient to identify volcanic ash soils (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref02">Anon 1973</a>), while the anion storage capacity test (previously termed phosphate retention test) developed in New Zealand (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref73">Saunders 1965</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref74">1968</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref09">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) is included in soil taxonomic criteria for confirmation of the dominance of amorphous material (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref80">Thomas <em>et al.</em> 1979</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref64">Piper (1944)</a> saw worth in measuring the anion exchange capacity of soils, including &#8216;exchangeable P&#8217;. This was obtained by treating soil with NaOH solution, thus replacing adsorbed P by the hydroxyl ion. Nowadays, anion exchange capacity is viewed as a misleading term from a P-sorption perspective. It is more informative to compare soils at equal residual concentrations of P in solution (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref06">Beckwith 1965</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">P sorption isotherms relate mathematically the amount of P sorbed by soil to the concentration remaining in corresponding equilibrating solutions under a specified set of conditions. Soil/solution ratio, the vigour, the temperature, period of extraction and the chemistry of the supporting electrolyte are critical variables. While the EPC and the slope of the isotherm can be derived for each soil, typically four or more analyses must be performed. This provides data richness but is analytically costly. An alternative is to use an &#8216;index&#8217; or similar approach that significantly lessens the analytical demand to one or two measurements (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref23">Dear <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_150"></a><a id="ch9fig2"></a><img src="../images/f0150-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 9.2.</strong> Continuous relationships between extractable P concentrations vs median robust % CVs for 72 samples and three methods, derived from 1997&#8211;2007 ASPAC Proficiency Testing Programs.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref05">Bache and Williams (1971)</a> developed a P sorption index based on one addition of 150 mg P/100 g soil with a 17 h period of equilibration. Their &#8216;index&#8217; related to the slopes of P sorption isotherms used to establish their test. Indeed, the slope is an isotherm&#8217;s most distinctive single-value feature. The slope of Q/I plots have also been used to estimate soil P buffering capacity. As soil P buffer capacity increases, the proportion of labile P taken up by plants, whether native or from fertiliser, tends to decrease. Labile soil P typically accounts for &#60;5% of TP, and is less tightly bound than stable P. Some labile P, as well as solution P, is measured with extractable soil P tests.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Other researchers support the &#8216;index&#8217; approach but with different equilibration conditions. For example, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref35">Holford and Cullis (1985)</a> demonstrated a concentration of 248 mg P/kg was well correlated with fertiliser effectiveness in wheat-growing soils of New South Wales. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> (1988)</a> suggested a concentration range for single-point sorption indices of 60&#8211;248 mg P/kg. The New Zealand anion storage capacity test uses a 1000 mg P/L equilibration solution with a contact time of 16 h at a 1:5 soil/solution ratio.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A PBI test has since been developed for use in Australia (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref16">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>) as a surrogate for characterising the P buffer capacity (P sorptivity or P &#8216;fixing&#8217; ability) of soils. This index originally included in its calculation Colwell-P (PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub>) or Olsen-P (PBI<sub>&#43;OlsenP</sub>), but recent research on a small data set (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref17">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>) suggests that an unadjusted PBI is better suited to commercial soil P testing, since it more accurately reflects changes in soil P sorption capacity following P fertilisation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_151"></a><em>Environmental P tests</em></h3>
<p class="para">Whether or not P moves off-site to waterways in quantities of environmental concern is influenced by:</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras1">&#8226;&#160;&#160;soil type and topography, including propensity to erode and whether the P remains water soluble or rapidly fixes in a form that resists relocation;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;distance from the paddock to a sensitive waterway or groundwater;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;direct transport via crop residues, farm animals, fire, and atmospheric cycling, often moderated by riparian vegetation and the like;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;type of nutrient carrier &#8211; e.g. commercial fertiliser (formulation, particle size, element, whether coated or otherwise), irrigation water, and bio-wastes;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;the presence/absence of soil and climatic conditions that prevent good plant growth, such as acid soil infertility, high salinity, a nutrient imbalance, adequate plant available water, etc.;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;the rate, timing and placement of the fertiliser relative to soil fertility status, crop rooting depth, stage of growth, freedom from disease, etc.;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;the area of land to which nutrients are applied, and</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras2">&#8226;&#160;&#160;whether the biochemistry of the waterway/water body encourages further releases of fixed P or alternatively assimilates the P in a benign manner.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Phosphorus is one of the main nutrients responsible for the eutrophication of waterways, causing the aquatic ecosystem&#8217;s primary productivity to increase in harmful ways. Effects include oxygen depletion and severe declines in water quality, fish, and other animal populations. Loss of P from land to water can occur via soil erosion, dissolved in runoff and via leaching. Soil P levels above those required for maximum economic production contribute to the environmental risk, which is exacerbated if portion of the soil P can dissolve in runoff water or in leachates.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Applications for soil P testing have now expanded in response to a growing need for P-based nutrient management plans. Specifically, soil tests to predict the risk of P transport in runoff have emerged (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref42">Maguire and Sims 2002</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref10">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref89">Withers <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>) and will increase in importance. Soil P tests may also be able to assess the likelihood that the P present in soils that reach and become bottom sediments in waterways have different degrees of redox sensitivity, sufficient to affect the release of soluble P to the water column (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref10">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two index or ratio tests to assess the risk of P transport in runoff are included. One is the Mehlich 3-P Saturation Ratio (M3PSR) (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref42">Maguire and Sims 2002</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref10">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>). A second option is provided by the ratio of Colwell-P/PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub> (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref53">Moody <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>). Methods based on extraction with 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (methods 9F1/9F2) also warrant consideration.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Soil preparation</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soil samples for P, irrespective of test, are best kept at &#8804;4&#176;C during transport to the laboratory, where they are usually dried, ground and/or sieved and stored before analysis. These processes enable soils to be analysed for a wide range of tests in addition to P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Drying may stimulate increased fragility of the organic P fraction of soils, thus leading to possible small changes in extractable soil P fractions (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref27">Etchevers 1986</a>). This possibility, however, is usually ignored for routine soil testing, where drying temperatures of &#8804;40&#8211;45&#176;C for &#8804;24 h are commonly recommended. Fine grinding of &#60;2 mm samples to &#8804;0.5 mm helps <a id="page_152"></a>lower sample heterogeneity and is often used in proficiency testing programs. For empirical tests, however, analysts should use the specified soil particle size.</p>
