<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec08"></a>9B2 Bicarbonate-extractable P (Colwell-P) &#8211; automated colour, continuous segmented flow/FIA</h3>
<p class="para">Segmented, continuous flow analysis (SFA) is broadly described by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref30">Gordon <em>et al.</em> (1993)</a> as well as in the preamble to Method 7A2a. Two SFA options are provided.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The colorimetric finish to this method is based on <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>. An earlier automated procedure (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref19">Colwell 1965</a>) is avoided as it uses heat to assist both neutralisation and &#8216;molybdenum blue&#8217; colour development. The text of Method 9B and the preamble to Method 9B1 contains further information on this soil P test, presently the most commonly used in Australia. There is no prior adjustment of soil pH, nor any attempt to remove possible interferences.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ethyl alcohol and Levor IV wetting agent (or equivalent) are included in the combined H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-molybdenum/ascorbic acid/antimony colour reagent to help prevent adsorption and/or precipitation of any phosphorus-molybdenum-antimony complex on or within the mixing coils, along lines suggested by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref72">Salt (1968)</a>. The automated acidification of soil extracts with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> prior to addition of colour reagents helps minimise positive interferences from soluble silicates. The wide soil/solution ratio lessens possible interferences from soluble organics.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For 47 Australian soils with Colwell-P levels (manual procedure described by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>) ranging from 2&#8211;48 mg P/kg, the linear relationship (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) between the manual (X) and automated procedure (Y), using split extracts, was Y = 1.029X&#8211;0.527.</p>
<p class="indent-para">While AutoAnalyzer I/II and microbore technologies are described, FIA provides an alternative analytical finish. It is acknowledged that the analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagrams provided for this method. Nevertheless, equivalence with the original manual procedure of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> should be no worse than the relationship given in the previous paragraph.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1.00 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL extracting bottles and add 100 mL Extracting Solution (0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5), stopper and mechanically shake end-over-end for 16 h at 25&#176;C. Centrifuge or filter prior to automated colorimetric analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ensure individual components of the bicarbonate SFA system (either AutoAnalyzer I/II technology or micro-bore technology) are connected as detailed on the relevant flow sheet (<a href="#ch9fig4">Figure 9.4</a> or <a href="#ch9fig5">Figure 9.5</a>, respectively) or in accord with the manufacturer&#8217;s instruction. Next, &#8216;condition&#8217; the manifold of choice (FIA is an alternative) before use, ensuring all CO<sub>2</sub> is removed at the B4 phase separator (or equivalent), and check instrument settings. Make occasional checks (Note 2) to ensure there is just sufficient acidity to prevent significant interference from silicates or from self-reduction of molybdate ions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine concentrations of P in the soil extracts directly (mg P/kg) from calibration standards run on commencement, after at least every 30 soil extracts, and on completion. Dilute soil extracts of high P concentrations with Extracting Solution. Instrument selections and settings should be in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Same-day measurement is preferred to limit the possibility of chemical and/or biological change: store filtered samples at 4&#176;C overnight only if same-day analysis is not possible.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report bicarbonate-extractable P (mg P/kg) on an air-dry basis.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Notes</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Distilled water is specified because it is typically free of organic impurities that can interfere with this reagent. Alternatively, deionised water can be used if it contains no significant organic impurities (including resin functional groups) that can sometimes interact with the reagent, with consequential adverse analytical effects.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Residual acidity during colour development has been designed to avoid self-reduction by molybdate ions, a situation that can occur if acidity is too low (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref11">Boltz and Mellon 1947</a>). Positive interference from Si may also occur if acidity is too low. To check, introduce two tubes of Si Solution in place of soil extracts. If a stable baseline is maintained, this is evidence that there is sufficient residual acidity present. If significant peaks are observed, the pump tube supplying H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to neutralise NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts may be delivering too little acid and/or the acid strength may need to be increased slightly.</p>
