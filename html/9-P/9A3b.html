<p class="para">Prepare digest solutions and standard solutions as per Method 9A3a. Filter [Whatman No. 1 (or equivalent) filter paper, 11 cm] or centrifuge an aliquot of the final digest solution if necessary. Complete the analysis by ICPAES using the appropriate wavelength for P. Examples include 213.618 nm for radial mode ICPAES and 178.221 nm for axial mode ICPAES, although other wavelengths are available (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref90">Yang <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine concentrations of KP in the soil digest solutions directly from standards (KCWS from 9A3a) run on commencement, during the &#8216;run&#8217;, and on completion. Dilute soil digest solutions of high concentrations with Reagent Blank, which also serves as the zero working standard.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report KP (% P) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
