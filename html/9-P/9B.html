<p class="para">This empirical method favours both readily available and the quantity component of soil P. It provides an estimate of P fertility via correlations with crop and pasture response to P on acid, neutral, and alkaline soils in several Australian regions (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref67">Rayment and Helyar 1980</a>). It has also been used to assess the &#8216;available&#8217; P status of many Australian soils (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref77">Stace <em>et al.</em> 1968</a>), and is one of two soil P tests required for the final calculation of PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ratings for bicarbonate-extractable P relevant to north-eastern Australia (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref15">Bruce and Rayment 1982</a>; <a href="#ch9tab4">Table 9.4</a>) provide guidance on levels typical of many natural surface soils. Soils with a significant past history of fertiliser applications could contain three or more times the upper value in <a href="#ch9tab4">Table 9.4</a>, while the vast majority of unfertilised Australian soils would rate as very low to low.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The bicarbonate extracting solution [0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5 (with NaOH)] is best when freshly prepared on the day of use. Moreover, there is no inclusion of activated C prior to soil extraction for 16 h at a soil/solution ratio of 1:100 (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>). The manual analytical finish of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> is based on <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>, following acidification of the bicarbonate extract with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. This acid is preferred to HCl for neutralisation of the bicarbonate extract, since the latter lowers the sensitivity of spectrophotometric methods involving the molybdophosphoric blue complex (e.g. <a href="chapter07.html#ch7tab1">Table 7-1</a> of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref37">Jackson 1962</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The alternative, automated analytical finish of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref19">Colwell (1965)</a> is no longer recommended, as it includes chemical modifications sufficient to sometimes affect the outcome, one being the use of HCl for neutralisation and the other involving strong heating. Papers by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref87">Watanabe and Olsen (1965)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref72">Salt (1968)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref24">Dick and Tabatabai (1977)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref78">Tarapchak (1983)</a> present evidence that hydrolysis of organic P is enhanced by long time periods for colour development, and by heating. Excessive acidification has also been shown (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref38">John 1970</a>) to elevate apparent P concentrations. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref44">McLeod (1982)</a> provides further information on NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-soluble P.</p>
