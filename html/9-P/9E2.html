<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec16"></a>9E2 Fluoride-extractable P (Bray 1-P) &#8211; continuous segmented flow/FIA automated colour</h3>
<p class="para">The automated colorimetric finish described (<a href="#ch09ref01">Abbott 1989</a>) is similar to procedures of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref13">Brewer <em>et al.</em> (1965)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref31">Grigg (1975)</a>. The colour reaction is based loosely on molybdate-Sb-ascorbic acid (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley 1962</a>), with separate manifolds for low P and high P soil extracts. The two P manifolds incorporate a heating step (85&#176;C). A boric-tartaric solution is used as a diluent in both manifolds, since the tetrafluoborate complex that forms does not interfere in the <a id="page_177"></a>subsequent molybdenum blue colour development. See the text of Method 9E and the preamble of Method 9E1 for further information on the Bray 1-P soil test.</p>
<p class="indent-para">While AutoAnalyzer I/II technology is described, microbore or FIA are appropriate alternatives, ideally without heating to speed colour development. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method. Nevertheless, the results obtained should be close to those obtained by Method 9E1.</p>

<p class="para">Weigh 7.14 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL flask or bottle, add 50 mL 0.03 M NH<sub>4</sub>F in 0.025 M HCl Extraction Solution. Stopper and shake for 60 sec at 25&#176;C. Immediately centrifuge or filter (Whatman No. 42) to obtain clear soil extracts. Concurrently, ensure individual components of the Bray 1-P manifolds for continuous flow analysis are connected as detailed on the relevant flowsheet: <a href="#ch9fig8">Figure 9.8</a> for low range P and <a href="#ch9fig9">Figure 9.9</a> for high range P. Instrument selections and settings should be in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Select the appropriate manifold for the expected soil P range and &#8216;condition&#8217; before use by pumping reagents and standard solutions. Make a final check on instrument settings then determine concentrations in soil extracts directly from relevant working standards run on commencement and as required throughout the batch of unknown soil extracts. Use the 0.03 M NH<sub>4</sub>F in 0.025 M HCl Extracting Solution as the wash solution and to dilute soil extracts with P concentrations above the range of Working Standards.</p>
