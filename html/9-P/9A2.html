<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec03"></a>9A2 Total P &#8211; sodium carbonate fusion</h3>
<p class="para">The reliable sodium carbonate fusion procedure is similar to that described by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref09">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1987)</a>, with modifications to suit Australian soils. Results compare favourably with perchloric acid digestion (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref59">O&#8217;Connor and Syers 1975</a>). It is preferred over persulfate digestion, which can give low recoveries caused by the incomplete extraction of P occluded within oxides and hydrous oxides of Fe.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Fusion with Sodium Carbonate</em></p>
<p class="para">Weigh 0.250 g of finely ground (&#60;0.1 mm) air-dry soil into a 60 mL platinum crucible or palau dish. Add approx. two-thirds of a weighed 3.0 g amount of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and stir thoroughly with a platinum wire or glass rod. Cover the mix with the residual 1 g Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Place the covered dish at a slight angle on a silica triangle over a Bunsen/Meeker gas burner. Heat gently for about 5 min until the sample is molten, carefully lifting cover to allow air to enter. It is important to ensure the burner&#8217;s flame does not completely envelop the dish in order to avoid reducing conditions during fusion. The hot crucible should be held with platinum-tipped tongs.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Increase heat gradually until full heat of the flame is being used. The bottom of the crucible/dish should be bright cherry-red. Maintain this heat for 25&#8211;30 min and periodically remove the lid to allow admission of air, and swirl the dish and contents. Any fusion mixture adhering to the underside of the lid should be fused by heating the lid in the flame.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Hold the crucible/dish with platinum-tipped tongs and swirl until melt has solidified around the sides. Cool and transfer contents of the crucible/dish plus lid to a 250 mL beaker. Wash any residue off the underside of the lid with about 2 mL of 4.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> from a graduated pipette, then set lid aside. Cover beaker with watch-glass and carefully add a further 13 mL of 4.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> into dish through the gap between beaker spout and a watch-glass cover. When effervescence has completely subsided, tip contents of the crucible/dish into the beaker and remove the crucible/dish after washing it thoroughly with hot deionised water.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Digest for 1 h on a boiling water bath and filter (Whatman No. 42) into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Wash beaker and filter paper with hot deionised water, cool, and make to volume. At this point, the P in solution can be measured as orthophosphate, as any polyphosphates that may form during fusion will be hydrolysed.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Analysis</em></h3>
<p class="para">Pipette a 10 mL aliquot of the prepared solution containing not more than 25 &#956;g P, into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Dilute with deionised water to about 80 mL and then adjust the solution to about pH 5 as follows: add 1 drop of <em>p</em>-nitrophenol indicator and then add 1 &#43; 1 NH<sub>4</sub>OH drop by drop until the solution just turns yellow (for a 10 mL aliquot this should take from 1.0 to 2.0 mL). Add 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> drop by drop until the solution just loses its yellow colour. Ignore any precipitates of Fe and Al hydroxides that may form, as these redissolve when acid molybdate is added during colour development. Add 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent, make to volume with deionised water and mix well. The colour remains stable for about 24 h and maximum intensity is reached in &#8776;10 min. After 30 min, measure the absorbance at 882 nm.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The P Working Standard solutions are treated with p-nitrophenol, etc., in the same manner as the diluted soil assays. Prepare a calibration curve of absorbance against concentration of the standards and interpolate (or calculate) the P concentration for the assays in &#956;g P in 100 mL.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_159"></a><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="para">For 0.25 g air-dry sample in 100 mL, and 10 mL aliquot in 100 mL:</p>
<p class="center-paras">% P = [P in final 100 mL (&#956;g P) &#215; 0.004]</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report total P (%) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
