<p class="para">Silicic acid is a general name for a family of chemical compounds with the general formula [SiO<sub>x</sub>(OH)<sub>4-2x</sub>]<sub>n</sub>. Simple silicic acids that occur in very dilute aqueous solution include metasilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>), orthosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), disilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and pyrosilicic acid (H<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>). A source is the acidification of Si salts such as sodium silicate in aqueous solution. In the oceans, soluble Si exists primarily as orthosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), while the most common aqueous forms of Si are H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> (<a href="#ch13ref28">van Dokkum <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Silicon is beneficial rather than essential for higher plants. Beneficial effects are reported to include lessening the P fixing capacity of soils, easing Al and Mn toxicity, promoting root growth, and perhaps contributing to disease resistance. Around 25&#8211;30% of the cropping soils of coastal Queensland (mainly cane fields) are rated as marginal to deficient in soluble Si, while Si is being continuously depleted from the root zone by crop removal, by soil loss, and in runoff water (e.g. <a href="#ch13ref06">Berthelsen <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Several empirical methods have been used with variable success to assess &#8216;plant-available&#8217; Si. These include demineralised water, 0.5 M acetic acid, 1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0), 0.5 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.8), 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, 0.5 M citric acid, Mehlich 3, 0.01 M calcium chloride (<a href="#ch13ref05">Barbosa-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>; <a href="#ch13ref06">Berthelsen <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>; <a href="#ch13ref09">de Lima Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch13ref30">Wang <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>) and 0.005 M sulfuric acid (<a href="#ch13ref11">Haysom and Kingston 1999</a>). The last two mentioned of these (0.01 M calcium chloride and 0.005 M sulfuric acid) plus unbuffered (pH 2.5) and buffered (pH 4.8) 0.5 M acetic acid have been examined against the responsiveness of sugar cane to Si in Queensland (<a href="#ch13ref11">Haysom and Kingston 1999</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The extraction procedure described provides an estimate of soluble Si plus the capacity of soils to supply Si (<a href="#ch13ref06">Berthelsen <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). According to <a href="#ch13ref14">Kingston (1999)</a>, who reported a strong correlation between Si from the 0.005 M sulfuric acid test and second-ratoon yields of sugar <a id="page_260"></a>cane, the &#8216;critical range&#8217; separating responsive from non-responsive sites was from 89&#8211;120 mg Si/kg. The test is used routinely in Queensland for Si and involves air-dry soil and overnight equilibration with 0.005 M sulfuric acid at 22&#8211;25&#176;C. Method 13D1 employs a silicomolybdous colorimetric finish (e.g. <a href="#ch13ref01">ASTM 2008</a>). A convenient alternative with an ICPAES analytical finish is coded as Method 13D2.</p>
