<p class="para">This method is identical to Method 13D1, except that ICPAES is used to measure the quantity of soluble Si in the 0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> clarified soil extracts. The soil/solution ratio is 1:200 and extraction time with 0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is 16 h. The method permits the analysis of higher solution Si concentrations (10 x), relative to the colorimetric finish.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 13.1</strong> A continuous, segmented flow sheet (AutoAnalyzer 1 technology) for acid-extractable Si.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch13ref30">Wang <em>et al.</em> (2004)</a> reported that for most but not all methods for extractable soil Si, there is good correlation between results by the silicomolybdous colorimetric finish and those obtained by ICPAES. The exceptions were Si extracted by Mehlich 3 and by water. Differences due to analytical finish for this and Method 13D1 have not been reported.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two emission lines, at 212.4 nm and 251.6 nm, are recommended for analysis of Si, with essentially identical results expected. The more sensitive Si emission line of 251.6 nm is preferred, however, unless the instrument manufacturer suggests otherwise.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Extraction Solution &#8211; 0.005 M Sulfuric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare as for Method 9G1, ensuring the deionised water contains non-detectable residues of soluble Si. This solution of 0.005M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is stable for long periods if kept free of dust and chemical contamination. Equilibrate to 22&#8211;25&#176;C prior to use and store in a covered plastic container.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Silica Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 13D1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1.0 &#177; 0.01 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL plastic extracting bottles and add 200 mL extracting solution (0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), stopper and mechanically shake end-over-end for 16 h at 22&#8211;25&#176;C. Alternatively, weigh 2.5 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 750 mL bottles, add 500 mL of extracting solution (0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and mechanically shake as above. After extraction, centrifuge or filter (Whatman No. 42 or No. 50 paper), discarding the first portion.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For ICPAES, aspirate clarified soil extracts and Working Standards (e.g. 0&#8211;5.0 mg Si/L or higher), select the 251.6 nm or 212.4 nm spectral line, as guided by the instrument <a id="page_263"></a>manufacturer. Use 0.005 M Sulfuric Acid Extracting Solution as the reagent blank and determine Si concentrations from a calibration curve (or regression equation).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report the results as mg Si/kg on an air-dry soil basis.</p>
