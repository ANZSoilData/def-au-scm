<p class="para">Loss-on-ignition (LOI) is a credible option when clients require approximate results for SOC and/or SOM (<a href="#ch06ref21">Davies 1974</a>). The same applies to estimates of soil carbonate.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The methodology is particularly suited to laboratories with a restricted suite of equipment and/or because the test avoids the problem of safe disposal of dichromate-sulfuric acid solutions (<a href="#ch06ref18">Craft <em>et al.</em> 1991</a>). The technology is well-established in laboratories that work with composts and manures, where LOI is used to determine ash content and by reciprocation, the OM content of these materials (<a href="#ch06ref39">Matthiessen <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). Because the method is relatively safe and inexpensive, it is widely used for diagnostic soil testing in the USA (<a href="http://www.agviselabs.com/tech_art/om.php">http://www.agviselabs.com/tech_art/om.php</a>). With few exceptions, elemental C contained in coal or charcoal or other carbonised material is also destroyed at ignition temperatures between 375&#8211;850&#176;C (<a href="#ch06ref05">Ball 1964</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The procedure involves the ignition of soils at high temperatures, thereby combusting the OM which is lost, along with any volatile solids that may also exist. There is no universal agreement, however, on the time and temperature of ignition. For example, <a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers (1996)</a> recommend ignition at 400&#176;C for 16 h, whereas the preferred combination for composting materials is 550&#176;C for 2 h (<a href="#ch06ref39">Matthiessen <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). In the method described, the temperature (500&#8211;550&#176;C) and time (2 h) for LOI to determine OM content derives from <a href="#ch06ref26">Heiri <em>et al.</em> (2001)</a>. Other steps in the procedure allow the calculation of soil moisture content at 40&#176;C and later, an estimate of soil carbonate content following further heating to 950&#176;C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method described does not account for the presence of any water of crystalisation that may still exist in some hydrated soil minerals across the temperature range 105&#8211;180&#176;C.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Apparatus</em></h3>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Borosilicate beakers or silica or porcelain crucibles (&#8776;20 mL capacity)</li>
<li>Laboratory drying oven set at 105&#176;C &#177; 2.5&#176;C</li>
<li>Muffle furnace set at 550&#176;C (range 500&#8211;550&#176;C)</li>
<li>Muffle furnace set at 950&#176;C &#177; 10&#176;C</li>
<li>Analytical balance capable of weighing &#177;0.01 mg</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Initially &#8216;condition&#8217; the numbered 20 mL beakers or crucibles at 550&#176;C for around 2 h, cool and determine the tare weight of each to 0.10 mg.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next add to each tared container a known weight (1&#8211;3 g of air-dry soil of &#60;0.5 mm maximum particle size; Weight<sub>40C</sub>) and heat in the laboratory drying oven at 105&#176;C for 24 h. Cool in a desiccator over fresh anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub> then determine weight of container + dry soil and subsequently the weight (g) of the oven-dry (105&#176;C) soil by subtraction (Weight<sub>105C</sub>). Now, place the containers with the dry soils in the pre-heated (500&#8211;550&#176;C) muffle furnace and continue the drying process. After 2 h, remove the containers + remaining soil from the muffle furnace, transfer containers carefully to the desiccator containing fresh anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub> to cool, then weigh as earlier described and obtain the weight of soil by subtraction (Weight<sub>550C</sub>). If an estimate of soil carbonate content is also required, continue the process by placing the 550&#176;C dried containers and samples in the muffle furnace set at 950&#176;C for 2 h to evolve all the CO<sub>2</sub> from any carbonate minerals. Remove the containers + remaining soil from the muffle furnace, cool in the desiccator containing fresh anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub>, then weigh as earlier described and obtain the weight of soil by subtraction (Weight<sub>950C</sub>).</p>
