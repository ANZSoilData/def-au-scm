<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter06sec12"></a>6E1 Potassium permanganate oxidisable C (PPOC)</h3>
<p class="para">This method guided by <a href="#ch06ref47">Moody and Cong (2008)</a> uses 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>. It targets labile or active SOC, including any WSOC that might be present. Results typically correlate with several key soil properties: aggregate stability (<a href="#ch06ref08">Blair <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>, <a href="#ch06ref09">1996</a>; <a href="#ch06ref07">Bell <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>); ECEC and pH buffer capacity (<a href="#ch06ref49">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>); and microbial biomass-C (<a href="#ch06ref48">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). Across a range of soils, PPOC is generally well correlated with TOC (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref49">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). At least portion of the measured PPOC, however, can sometimes be the result of short-term land management practices that add highly labile WSOC to the &#8216;system&#8217; (sucrose is an example). Elevated BOD in adjacent natural waters can result if this WSOC leaves the site in runoff (<a href="#ch06ref56">Rayment 2003</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">An earlier method of oxidising SOC by permanganate (<a href="#ch06ref36">Loginow <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) used 0.333 M, 0.167 M, and 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub> to differentiate three fractions whereas <a href="#ch06ref83">Weil <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> preferred 0.02 M KMnO<sub>4</sub> as the oxidising agent. The inclusion of CaCl<sub>2</sub> in the reagent is to enhance flocculation of the soil extracts. Reaction time is precisely 2 min plus precisely 5 min of subsequent standing/settling time.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Reagent Water</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 6A1.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_83"></a><em>0.1 M Calcium Chloride</em></p>
<p class="param">Dissolve 14.7 g calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) and make to 1.0 L with Reagent Water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>0.033 M Potassium Permanganate</em></p>
<p class="param">Dissolve 5.2151 g analytical grade potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) in Reagent Water in a small beaker with stirring and heating (use a hotplate no warmer than 60&#176;C) until fully dissolved. Filter through a funnel containing a plug of washed borosilicate glass wool and dilute to 1.0 L in a volumetric flask. Store the solution in an amber glass bottle or in the dark.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Standard Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate Solution (0.0405 M)</em></p>
<p class="param">1 mL contains 4.504 mg of C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Weigh and dissolve 9.5728 g potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; previously dried for 2 h at 110&#176;C) and make volume to 1.0 L with Reagent Water. (This C-standard is only required for double-checking purposes.)</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Working Standard Solutions</em></p>
<p class="param">Whether testing in the laboratory or in the field, prepare five Working Standard Solutions from the same batch of 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>, Reagent Water and 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> as outlined below. For Working Standards 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, accurately add 20, 15, 10, 5 and 0 (zero) mL of Reagent Water, then dispense sequentially and accurately into the same flasks 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0 and 25.0 mL of 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub> (same batch as to be used for the unknowns) and mix well. The molarities of KMnO<sub>4</sub> in these Working Standards equate to 6.6, 13.2, 19.8, 26.4 and 33 mM KMnO<sub>4</sub>, respectively. Next add 1.0 mL of 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> to each standard solution and mix well.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add 1.0 mL of each of the five Working Standard Solutions to a set of numbered, 50 mL calibrated plastic tubes and add Reagent Water to the 50 mL mark. Cap and shake by hand. Prepare these Working Standard Solutions on the day of use. If for field use, take to the field already prepared.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure &#8211; field</em></h3>
<p class="para">Combine and mix soil sub-samples and then air dry a thin layer of each soil sample in the sun for 1 h in a dust-free place. After this drying step, crush and remix the sample, ideally to a particle size of &#60;2 mm.</p>
<p class="indent-para">At a similar time, set up a portable colorimeter (e.g. a palm-top Hach&#174; colorimeter able to measure absorbance at 550 nm) for later use.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Weigh 5.0 g of the field-dried soil (or use a suitable scoop equivalent to 5 g soil) into a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube, noting that weight/volume relationships can vary with soil type, and whether recently cultivated or otherwise. Into each tube dispense accurately 25.0 mL of 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution then add 1 mL of 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution to assist flocculation of soil particles. Cap the tube then shake the mixture by hand for precisely 2 min. Leave the mixture to stand for precisely 5 min, then immediately take 1 mL of the supernatant using a pipette and dilute this aliquot in a plastic centrifuge tube to the 50 mL mark with Reagent Water (or water known to be free of dissolved OC).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Zero the portable colorimeter (or spectrophotometer) with Reagent Water and measure the absorbances of all standard solutions and samples at a wavelength of 550 nm (see Note 1). Plot mM KMnO<sub>4</sub> of the five Working Standards (x-axis) against absorbance (y-axis) and either draw a straight line through the points or fit a regression line to the relationship. Use this <a id="page_84"></a>relationship to determine the concentration of KMnO<sub>4</sub> (mM) left in the unknown samples after the oxidation period.</p>
<p class="indent-para">As an occasional check on the quality of reagents, particularly 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>, dispense (say) 1 mL and 2 mL of Standard Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate Solution into the 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes normally used for unknown soil samples. Evaporate the dispensed standard solutions to dryness in an oven, at not greater than 65&#176;C, then cool to room temperature before dispensing accurately 25.0 mL of 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution, adding 1 mL of 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and continuing as previously described. These should contain 4.504 and 9.008 mg of C, respectively. If not the case, double-check the quality of the KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure &#8211; laboratory</em></h3>
<p class="para">When performed in the laboratory, the soil samples should arrive as quickly as possible following field sampling or otherwise kept at or below 4&#176;C during transportation in order to suppress biological activity prior to efficient air drying at 40&#176;C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">After drying, crush, grind or sieve the soils to &#60;0.5 mm, then weigh 5.0 &#177; 0.1 g and proceed as described for the field procedure. Expect laboratory-performed tests to be slightly higher in PPOC and also more precise than for corresponding soils analysed in the field.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculations (field and laboratory)</em></h3>
<p class="para">Use the following equation to calculate PPOC with units of g C/kg. This is based on the assumption that each 1.0 mM of MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> consumed in reducing Mn<sup>7+</sup> to Mn<sup>2+</sup> is equivalent to the oxidation of 0.75 mM of C (or 9.008 mg of C). The following equation takes this and the soil/solution ratio into account:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0084-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="paran">where:</p>
<p class="paran"><em>M<sub>0</sub></em> = initial concentration of KMnO<sub>4</sub> (0.033 M = 33 mM)</p>
<p class="paran"><em>M<sub>1</sub></em> = concentration of KMnO<sub>4</sub> (mM) after oxidation (calculated from standard calibration curve)</p>
<p class="paran1">Report PPOC (g C/kg) on an air-dry basis.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;If the absorbance of any sample is less than 0.4, repeat the extraction using 2.5 g of soil instead of 5 g of soil, to ensure excess KMnO<sub>4</sub> is present throughout the reaction.</p>
