<p class="para">Catalysed, high temperature combustion methods (Dumas C) estimate total soil C when charcoal and carbonates/bicarbonates are present in the samples presented for analysis. TOC is applicable only when these &#8216;interferences&#8217; are absent or removed prior to analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Procedures are provided that employ high temperature combustion of around 1050&#8211;1200&#176;C but with different means of measuring the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> liberated. The first, now largely superseded by superior technology, involves volumetric measurement of the liberated gases (Method 6B2a). Method 6B2b uses contemporary technology, albeit different instrument manufacturers may vary catalysts, furnace temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing technologies to optimise measurement performance. Method 6B3 is similar to Method 6B2b, except it incorporates a chemical pre-treatment step to remove positive interferences from carbonates/bicarbonates plus the earlier physical removal of visible charcoal and similar sources of elemental C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">From a workplace health and safety perspective, laboratories that employ O<sub>2</sub>-enriched, high temperature combustion methods must take precautions to prevent burns and fires, and also while handling compressed gases. Avoid open flames and sparks and have a fire blanket and an appropriate fire extinguisher close to hand.</p>
