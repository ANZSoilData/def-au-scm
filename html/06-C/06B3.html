<p class="para">Many soils, such as Australia&#8217;s Calcarosols (these are calcareous throughout; see <a href="#ch06ref28">Isbell 1996</a>), contain quantities of carbonate minerals sufficient to cause positive errors in the measurement of TOC. In addition, wood, charcoal and peat often contain small amounts of absorbed carbonates from percolating groundwater, while shells are another potential source of positive errors in the measurement of TOC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Little can be done quickly and confidently to remove all charcoal and the like from routine samples, other than to visually inspect and then to physically remove such materials, prior to commencement of soil grinding operations (see Note 1).</p>
<p class="indent-para">As for carbonate minerals, one option is to separately determine soil carbonate content (Methods 19A, 19B or 20H1 are preferred; see Note 2) and adjust the apparent SOC content to the amount of C present, noting the concentration in CaCO<sub>3</sub> is &#8776;12% C. There are times, <a id="page_78"></a>however, such as in isotopic-dating studies, when solid-phase carbonates need to be removed chemically prior to SOC analysis (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref27">Higham, undated</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Chemical pretreatment with dilute acids to remove carbonates is common (<a href="#ch06ref23">Fernandes and Krull 2008</a>), with treatment with 5% sulfurous acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) preferred, using the procedure described by <a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers (1996)</a>. Other chemical approaches include <em>in situ</em> treatment with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> in silver capsules (<a href="#ch06ref23">Fernandes and Krull 2008</a>) and treatment with 10% HCl followed by rinsing with water (<a href="#ch06ref27">Higham, undated</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following quantitative pre-treatment, the residual sample must be analysed for soil C by a suitable method, usually Method 6B2b.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Additional Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Reagent Water</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 6A1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>4 M HCl</em></p>
<p class="param">Dilute 40 mL reagent grade HCl (10 M) to 100 mL with Reagent Water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>&#8776;5% Sulfurous acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) (an aqueous solution of SO<sub>2</sub>)</em></p>
<p class="para">Purchase commercially or alternatively bubble (with care in a fume cabinet) sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) gas through an aliquot of Reagent Water until a saturated solution is obtained. The SO<sub>2</sub> can be made by the controlled burning of elemental S or by carefully roasting various sulfide ores in a fume cabinet. Store in a stoppered, borosilicate bottle to prevent rapid loss of SO<sub>2</sub> (a poisonous gas) from the saturated solution.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sodium Hydroxide (pellets)</em></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure &#8211; carbonate removal and dry combustion</em></h3>
<p class="para">Initially remove any charcoal, wood, coal or the like, prior to commencement of soil grinding operations. Also perform a spot-test for the presence of significant carbonate. To do this, place a portion of a finely-ground sub-sample (&#60;0.5 mm) on a &#8216;spot plate&#8217;, moisten with a few drops of Reagent Water, then add 4 M HCl drop-wise to the wetted sample, and inspect for the presence of any effervescence, allowing up to at least 5 min for reaction with dolomite to occur. If there is no visible reaction and no reason to otherwise suspect the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate, then proceed to determine SOC by Method 6B2b.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When carbonate-C is confirmed and accurate measurement of TOC is essential, &#8216;condition&#8217; a series of non-porous combustion &#8216;boats&#8217; by igniting them to remove all traces of carbonate (and other forms of C), cool, number and tare. Also take a known weight of the finely-ground sub-sample (&#60;0.5 mm), based on the capacity of the combustion analyser and of the vessel used in the combustion analyser (be guided by the final sample-weight requirements of Method 6B2b). Treat each sample separately (and quantitatively) with an excess of 5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> solution on a hot plate in a fume cabinet free of C contamination. Subsequently, remove excess acid and residual moisture over several hours before loading vessels into combustion analyser as in Method 6B2b.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report TOC (% C; Method 6B3) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion, based on the initial sample weight. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Notes:</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;If chemical removal of charcoal is essential, refer to procedures used by <a href="#ch06ref65">Skjemstad <em>et al.</em> (1994)</a> and by <a href="#ch06ref38">Masiello <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para"><a id="page_79"></a>2.&#160;&#160;A practical alternative is to measure the total soil C on both untreated and treated samples, thus obtaining total soil C, TOC and inorganic C. Also note that Method 19A1 can overestimate acid neutralising capacity of soil because of the higher strength of acid used, relative to 20H1.</p>
