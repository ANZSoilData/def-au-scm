<p class="para">This method, originally coded as 6B3 by <a href="#ch06ref58">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, is similar to Method 6B2a, except that the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by O<sub>2</sub>-enriched, high-temperature combustion (e.g. LECO 2000 Series Induction Analyser or similar equivalents from several manufacturers including Vairomax, Elementar and Shimadzu) is measured by technology quantitative for CO<sub>2</sub>, typically infrared detection or thermal conductivity detection, supported by a microprocessor. The method only provides an accurate result for TOC in soil samples with no carbonate minerals and with no charcoal &#8211; and similar materials containing elemental C (see <a href="#ch06ref42">Merry and Spouncer 1988</a>; <a href="#ch06ref29">ISO 10694 1995</a>; <a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers 1996</a>; and <a href="#ch06ref33">Kerven <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>). When these are present, the result equates to total soil C. The temperature of ignition is controlled, with near-complete combustion of OC occurring at O<sub>2</sub>-enriched furnace temperatures of around 900&#176;C (<a href="#ch06ref74">Tiessen and Moir 1993</a>), although some instruments have the capacity to acquire additional information by applying different temperature sequences.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_77"></a><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Set up and maintain the high-temperature combustion analyser in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. <a href="#ch06ref74">Tiessen and Moir (1993)</a> warn that in routine use at high temperatures, hairline cracks may form in the ceramic tube of the combustion furnace, causing leaks and low CO<sub>2</sub> recoveries.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Calibrate using CaCO<sub>3</sub> (12.0003% C), acetanilide (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>; MW 135.16; 71.09% C), or certified soil material. Calibrations may be developed for specific types of samples.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Typically weigh between 0.5 and 0.75 g finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm; 40&#176;C) air-dry soil into a ceramic &#8216;boat&#8217; (or vessels recommended by the instrument&#8217;s manufacturer) and spread evenly. For soils containing high C concentrations, place a layer of ignited silica sand (or a proprietary combustion controller) over the weighed sample to slow combustion. This overcomes the possibility that a high rate of combustion can over-saturate the detection cell.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Set furnace temperature to 900&#176;C (or as recommended up to &#8776;1050&#8211;1300&#176;C). Also, repack the reagent [anhydrous magnesium perchlorate; Mg(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] tubes whenever the reagent becomes caked or moist or the warning alarm sounds, noting Mg(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a strong oxidiser that also causes respiratory tract irritation and other health disorders of the eyes, skin and central nervous system. A quality control sample of known soil C concentration should be included in each batch of around 10 samples.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report total C (%) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
