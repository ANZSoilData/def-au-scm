<h2 class="h2a">Carbon</h2>
<p class="para">Carbon (C) occurs in soils in many forms. These include carbonate minerals (mostly calcite and dolomite), HCO<sub>3</sub> &#175; (<a href="#ch06ref55">Pratt 1966</a>), elemental C (e.g. charcoal; &#8776;60&#8211;98% C), OM from plant and animal residues, and as CO<sub>2</sub>, which can be both free and dissolved in the soil solution. Organic C, includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, waxes, residues of micro-organisms, and complex molecules termed humic substances (<a href="#ch06ref77">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The important contribution of SOC to the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils, including soil CEC, is well documented (<a href="#ch06ref52">Parfitt 1980</a>; <a href="#ch06ref71">Stevenson 1986</a>). It is also known that soil degradation problems caused by exploitative farming practices are often accompanied by declines in SOC (<a href="#ch06ref16">Chan <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). Soil properties and how these are modified by land use are influenced by the nature and degree of decomposition of the OM &#8216;pool&#8217;. Complex OC, which involves associations between OC and soil clay particles, affects water retention and soil bulk density in predictable ways (<a href="#ch06ref22">Dexter <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">More labile (reactive) and water-soluble forms of SOC influence soil acidity, nutrient availability, the toxicity and transport of metals (<a href="#ch06ref75">Thurman 1985</a>), and the BOD of adjacent water bodies, following land runoff as the transport pathway (<a href="#ch06ref56">Rayment 2003</a>). SOC features at lower taxonomic levels in Soil Taxonomy, such as in ustollic and fluventic sub-groups (<a href="#ch06ref68">Soil Survey Staff 1975</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soils account for around two-thirds of the OC of terrestrial ecosystems in active exchange with the atmosphere. Much of this SOC has a residence time of around 1200 y (<a href="#ch06ref54">Post <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>). Typically, soil C density increases in undisturbed ecosystems with decreasing temperature for any level of rainfall, albeit SOC density is usually enhanced in humid regions relative to arid areas exposed to the same level of soil weathering. In practice, OC levels are commonly highest in surface horizons, as this is where most biological activity occurs in fertile, well-drained soils (<a href="#ch06ref19">Dalal and Chan 2001</a>). Insects such as ants and termites, birds and animals, which dig into and dwell in soil, also relocate OM at points of activity (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref35">Lobry de Bruyn and Conacher 1990</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The amounts of soil C vary from almost zero in silica sand to &#8805;60% in peaty soils that contain accumulations of partially decayed vegetative material and few soil mineral constituents. Peaty soils develop in places where poor drainage and/or sustained low temperatures inhibit the decomposition of plant residues by micro-organisms. In contrast, SOM quite quickly breaks down in warm to hot, moist, fertile, aerated soils of the subtropics and tropics.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Laboratory estimates of SOC contents are restricted to the quantity and condition of organic materials that accompany soil particles through a 2 mm sieve (<a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers 1996</a>), after the removal of obvious plant debris. Finer grinding is commonly recommended prior to analysis to improve soil homogeneity and to lessen the effects of using a small sample size. Aside from mineral-bound forms of C contained in carbonates and the like, most analytical methods on prepared samples focus on total and (less commonly) labile forms of OC. In the case of &#8216;totals&#8217;, conversion factors are often used to estimate total SOM from measured SOC concentrations. Conversion factors range from 1.72 to 2.2 (<a href="#ch06ref04">Baldock and Skjemstad 1999</a>; <a href="#ch06ref22">Dexter <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>; <a href="#ch06ref02">Aust. Std. 4419, 2003)</a>, with the factor 1.724 suggested for use as follows but only when site-specific information is unavailable (<a href="#ch06ref67">Sleutel <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>); i.e.:</p>

<p class="center-para">SOM = [SOC (same units for both) &#215; 1.724]</p>
<p class="indent-para">As reported by <a href="#ch06ref14">Bruce and Rayment (1982)</a>, <a href="#ch06ref69">Spain <em>et al.</em> (1983)</a> and others, the OC contents of Australian soils of different types and locations are mostly &#60;5% C. Desert loams and earthy sands typically contain &#60;0.1% C, whereas humus-rich soils from alpine regions can contain from 7&#8211;14% C (<a href="#ch06ref04">Baldock and Skjemstad 1999</a>). <a href="#ch06ref79">Vortman (1980)</a> reported SOC concentrations in surface horizons of 11 New Zealand reference soils of 1.2&#8211;9.5% C (wet oxidation method), with a median of 4.3% C, whereas median concentrations at around 50 and 100 cm in the same soils were mostly much lower (0.8 and 0.2% C, respectively). Ratings for total SOC applicable to soil and land use surveys from New Zealand and north-eastern Australia are provided in <a href="#ch6tab1">Table 6.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The many different forms and concentrations of soil C challenge the analyst. Also at issue is whether the concentration and forms of soil C, including total and labile forms, need to be known accurately or only approximately. Methods are included that address these different requirements.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Specifically, methods for the determination of SOC have evolved from separate chemical reactions and from reaction kinetics. One, attributed to Walkley and Black (W&#38;B: <a href="#ch06ref81">Walkley and Black 1934</a>; <a href="#ch06ref80">Walkley 1947</a>), involves wet oxidation by a dichromate-sulfuric acid (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> &#8211; H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) mixture.</p>
<p class="indent-para">With wet oxidation (<a href="#ch06ref80">Walkley 1947</a>), SOM acts to reduce Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> at elevated temperature. Recoveries of SOC are usually incomplete when there is total reliance on heat of reaction (Method 6A1). Typical recoveries are around 75&#8211;90% for surface soils, and vary with soil type and depth. Therefore, C concentrations are reported as OC<sub>W&#38;B</sub>, without any attempt to convert to total OC by a multiplication factor. When estimates of total SOC by wet oxidation are preferred, the method of <a href="#ch06ref25">Heanes (1984)</a> is available (Method 6B1). It incorporates an external heating step to encourage complete oxidation of SOC. Both wet oxidation methods require correction for positive interference from Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in saline soils, while the presence of solid-phase carbonates can lower the expected heat of reaction by &#8216;consuming&#8217; some of the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> reagent. Across 72 test samples used in soil inter-laboratory proficiency programs of ASPAC from 1997 to 2007 (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref53">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch06ref59">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>), grand median results by catalysed, high temperature combustion relative to corresponding OC<sub>W&#38;B</sub> results were 1.08:1 across a concentration range of 0.12&#8211;6.4% C.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_67"></a>Three methods included are based on the release of CO<sub>2</sub> following high-temperature combustion of small quantities of sample. These catalysed methods for SOC (Dumas C) measure total soil C, including charcoal and carbonates/bicarbonates (unless these are absent or removed prior to analysis). The technology mostly utilises microprocessor-controlled equipment (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref42">Merry and Spouncer 1988</a>). Such equipment has proven robust and reliable, although results can vary slightly between instruments (<a href="#ch06ref67">Sleutel <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>), likely to be due to the temperature of combustion. More details are given in preambles to Method 6B2 (6B2a, 6B2b) and to Method 6B3.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Total SOC can also be predicted by correlations between both NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy or MIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and conventionally measured total SOC values (<a href="#ch06ref30">Janik <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>; <a href="#ch06ref45">Meyer 1998</a>; <a href="#ch06ref37">Malley <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#ch06ref84">Zimmermann <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). These non-destructive methods are coded as 6B4a and 6B4b, respectively. They create no adverse environmental wastes but accuracy depends on the quality of conventionally measured total SOC values and the mathematical algorithm/s used for the correlations. As soil carbonate minerals may interfere with infrared spectra, relationships tend to be strongest when carbonates have been removed by pre-treatment and when applied to neutral and acidic soils containing no carbonates. Obviously, chemical pre-treatment (if preferred to separately estimating and adjusting for carbonate) will remove some of the original soil mass, which must be taken into account. Also, the soil must be redried following chemical pre-treatment.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Also described are methods for more labile forms of SOC (Methods 6C1, 6D1, and 6E1).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Method 6C1 quantifies POM by using physical separation based on particle size. POM is quite reactive, and is the form of OC easily lost as a consequence of cultivation (<a href="#ch06ref15">Cambardella and Elliott 1992</a>). Accordingly, knowledge of POM concentrations in soils (reported as % C) can help improve understanding of the role POM plays in the turnover of SOM, a process that helps in the cycling of essential plant nutrients.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Method 6D1 determines the fraction of soil C extractable by the pyrophosphate reagent described in Method 13B1. <a href="#ch06ref11">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1987)</a> consider this method to be relevant to the identification of spodic horizons in Soil Taxonomy, when pyrophosphate-extractable Fe values are &#60;0.1%. (The spodic horizon &#8211; from Gr. spodos, wood ash &#8211; is a dark-coloured subsurface horizon that contains illuvial amorphous substances composed of OM and Al, with or without Fe.) The pyrophosphate solution extracts low molecular weight OM associated with Fe and Al in organic complexes and in short-order minerals such as ferrihydrite.</p>
<p class="indent-para">With growing interest in indicators of soil health, easily-reactive forms of SOC have attracted attention, particularly those based on permanganate-oxidisable OC (<a href="#ch06ref10">Blair <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>). This is because the quantities of OC oxidised by dilute solutions of potassium permanganate (e.g. 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>) correlate with many important soil properties (<a href="#ch06ref49">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). Method 6E1 derives from <a href="#ch06ref83">Weil <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> and <a href="#ch06ref47">Moody and Cong (2008)</a> and is suited to laboratory and field use. It uses brief (2 min) soil contact with aqueous 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>, followed by 5 min standing in the presence of aqueous 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the latter added to flocculate soil particles. The method also responds to the presence of WSOC, such as sucrose lost via cane juice during mechanical harvesting of sugarcane or contained in recycled filter mud from sugarmills (<a href="#ch06ref57">Rayment and Bohl 2002</a>). <a href="#ch06ref82">Wang <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> reported 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> - leachate concentrations of soluble OM from five Australian soils of 127&#8211;133 mg C/kg.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The presence of charcoal in soils confounds interpretation of SOC. Even OC<sub>w&#38;B</sub> (Method 6A1), which uses heat of reaction to oxidise OC, may not discriminate between finely dispersed charcoal and SOC. The finer the charcoal particles, the greater the chances that at least some will be oxidised. Accordingly, traditional methods for OC, which include Methods 6A1 to 6B3, can slightly overestimate OM that might be available for microbiological decomposition. Methods for charcoal-C have been described by <a href="#ch06ref66">Skjemstad <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a>, using ultraviolet photo-oxidation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and by <a href="#ch06ref24">Glaser <em>et al.</em> (1998)</a>, using benzenepolycarboxylic acids as markers for charcoal-C during HNO<sub>3</sub> digestions. These methods are not described herein, as they are analytically time-consuming and expensive. Instead, a method is described (Method 6F1) that uses peroxide and dilute HNO<sub>3</sub>, with heating to oxidise OC and to quantitatively allow charcoal-C to be determined by dry combustion.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 6.1.</strong> Soil OC concentrations vs % robust CVs, derived from ASPAC soil inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The final method (6G1) provides a useful estimate of SOM, based on loss-on-ignition. It requires only relatively simple laboratory equipment (precision balance; oven; desiccator) and depends on the knowledge that ignition of soils at 500&#8211;550&#176;C for 2 h removes almost all OM with little dehydroxylation of clay minerals (<a href="#ch06ref26">Heiri <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). If operated sequentially, the same soil sample and tared container can be used to measure the moisture held between air drying (40&#176;C) and oven drying (105&#176;C), including most water of crystallisation; a rough estimate of SOM, plus an estimate of soil carbonate content, obtained from the loss of weight across the temperature range 550&#8211;950&#176;C. Based on unpublished data of B. Daly, the upper temperature range may be insufficient to completely remove shell carbonates from all New Zealand soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The methods described in this chapter, what they measure, and an indication of the accuracy or reliability of the measurements, are summarised in <a href="#ch6tab2">Table 6.2</a> and discussed further in preambles to each method. <a href="#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1</a> shows how robust co-efficients of variation varied continuously with SOC concentrations by two methods, when homogenous soils of &#60;0.5 mm were analysed. The data were sourced from laboratories across Australasia that participated in ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007, including those reported by <a href="#ch06ref53">Peverill and Johnstone (1997)</a> and <a href="#ch06ref59">Rayment <em>et al.</em> (2007)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Irrespective of method, analytical cleanliness is essential, because dust, dirt and fumes containing elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations can lead to positive errors (<a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers 1996</a>), particularly at low soil C concentrations. Similarly, all soil sampling and grinding equipment should be free of oil and corrosion inhibitors, as these substances can transfer to the sample, adding to the apparent soil C content. Fine grinding of &#60;2 mm soil samples to &#8804;0.5 mm helps increase repeatability by decreasing soil heterogeneity (<a href="#ch06ref25">Heanes 1984</a>), and can elevate apparent results slightly (<a href="#ch06ref42">Merry and Spouncer 1988</a>).</p>
