<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter06sec04"></a>6B2a Total organic C &#8211; Dumas high-temperature combustion, volumetric (no soil pretreatment)</h3>
<p class="para">This method from <a href="#ch06ref58">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, originally coded as 6B2, involves production, purification and measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> evolved when soil C is ignited in a stream of O<sub>2</sub>. It only provides an accurate result for TOC in soil samples with no carbonate minerals and no charcoal (and similar materials containing elemental C). In their presence, the result equates to total soil C.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_74"></a>Equipment and reagents supplied by the Laboratory Equipment Corporation (LECO), St Joseph, Michigan (USA) are suitable for this purpose.</p>
<p class="indent-para">High temperature (&#8805;1300&#8211;1400&#176;C) can be produced by a high frequency electrical flux induced in a mixture of the soil sample and a conducting matrix of Fe chips. The gas produced is purified of dust, precipitated silver (Ag) is used to remove chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), any carbon monoxide (CO) is converted to CO<sub>2</sub>, while sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is removed with manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>). The purified CO<sub>2</sub> is determined by a volumetric procedure.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Because all C compounds are converted to CO<sub>2</sub>, C from carbonates, charcoal, undecomposed wood, etc, will be included in the result, unless absent or removed in advance, noting that unglazed sample &#8216;boats&#8217; are not suitable for pretreatment with acid to remove carbonates. Therefore, soils containing carbonates/bicarbonates should be analysed by Method 6B3, or the apparent results corrected for the percentage of carbonate/bicarbonate determined by separate analysis (Method 19A1 or 19B1). Corrective actions (if any) for the minimisation of interferences should be noted when reporting results.</p>
<p class="indent-para">CO<sub>2</sub> is measured volumetrically, which nowadays is superseded technology. The resultant gases (CO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>) are passed into a calibrated burette in which 5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is displaced. The CO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> are flushed through concentrated KOH solution, thus absorbing the CO<sub>2</sub> evolved. The difference between the original volume of gas in the burette and the volume of CO<sub>2</sub>-free gas equals the volume of CO<sub>2</sub> evolved. The soil C content is equated after correction for temperature and pressure.</p>

<p class="para1"><em>Sulfur trap</em></p>
<p class="param">Moist MnO<sub>2</sub> has a tendency to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in low results. Minimise this by placing the S-trap immediately after the CO-converter furnace. If fresh MnO<sub>2</sub> is used, pass copious amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> through the S-trap and then flush with O<sub>2</sub> to remove any excess CO<sub>2</sub>. If the S-trap is kept free of water, renewal of the MnO<sub>2</sub> and subsequent flushing with CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> are required infrequently.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh samples of air-dry (&#8776;40&#176;C) and finely-ground (&#60;0.5 mm) soil, according to the expected C content as shown in <a href="#ch6tab3">Table 6.3</a>. For a 1.00 g sample of soil, load a crucible successively with 1 scoop (delivering about 1.0 g) of Fe chips, the soil sample, &#189; scoop tin (Sn) metal and 2 scoops Fe chips. For samples &#60;1.00 g, load crucibles with 1 scoop of Fe chips, soil sample, silicic acid, &#189; scoop Sn metal and 2 scoops Fe chips. Silicic acid is included to increase viscosity of the molten material, thus decreasing crucible failures.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare blank crucibles, loaded with reagents but with soil omitted, and run these until a zero reading is obtained before proceeding with samples; usually 2 or 3 blanks are required. The preferred combustion temperature is &#8776;1050&#8211;1200&#176;C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Place a loaded crucible on the pedestal and adjust the flow-rate of O<sub>2</sub> to 0.8 L/min. Raise pedestal into the induction field; this simultaneously closes the system and initiates induction. Combustion gases are passed through a dust trap, a Cl<sub>2</sub> trap, a converter furnace, and an S-trap before reaching the volumetric analyser. Frequently clean and dry the calico filter and delivery tube leading to the dust trap in order to prevent absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by water and dust.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When the reaction is complete, as indicated by the level of acid remaining static in the measuring burette, stop the O<sub>2</sub> flow and remove the sample by lowering the pedestal.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Read % C directly from the appropriate scale (determined by the sample weight) on the calibrated burette. Correct this value by a factor dependent on the temperature of the CO<sub>2</sub> and atmospheric pressure: refer to <a href="#ch6tab4">Table 6.4</a>, or as guided by the instrument manufacturer. An appropriate chemical to double check on measurement accuracy is analytical grade acetanilide (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>; MW 135.16; 71.09% C).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report total C (%), on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
