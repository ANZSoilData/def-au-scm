<p class="para">Considerable retained acidity may be stored in ASS in the form of jarosite and similar relatively insoluble Fe and Al hydroxy sulfate compounds. Their acidity and S are not recovered in the 1 M KCl suspensions of TAA (Method 20B1) and S<sub>KCl</sub> (Method 20D1); however, they are soluble in 4 M HCl as are other sources of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>. The difference in the S extracted by 4 M HCl and by 1M KCl [S<sub>NAS</sub> (net acid soluble S) = S<sub>HCl</sub>&#8211; S<sub>KCl</sub>] provides an estimate of the insoluble (jarositic) S content of soils (<a href="#ch20ref16">McElnea and Ahern 2004c</a>). Sulfur is commonly determined by ICPAES. On highly organic soil samples, however, 4 M HCl may extract appreciable organic S. Therefore, unless a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> specific technique is used, such as IC (Method 20F2), the S<sub>NAS</sub> result will be inflated.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_446"></a>The method involves the extraction of dry soil with 4 M HCl at a ratio of 1:40. The extract is centrifuged and the clear supernatant is analysed for S. Results are reported as % S (ideally SO<sub>4</sub>-S) on an oven-dry basis. The 4 M HCl treatment will extract soluble and adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, as well as SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> from gypsum, jarosite or other insoluble SO<sub>4</sub>2&#8211;salts. Acid volatile sulfides will be dissolved and lost to H<sub>2</sub>S after 4 M HCl extraction, if not already lost in the sampling, transportation or drying process. Pyrite-S will largely remain unaffected by this acid extraction process (<a href="#ch20ref19">Morse and Cornwell 1987</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>4 M HCl</em></p>
<p class="para">Add 400 mL of 31.5&#8211;33% w/v (or equivalent) HCl to an equal volume of deionised water, mix well, cool to room temperature, then make to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sulfur Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 5000 mg of S.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dry anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) at 105&#176;C for 4 h, cool in a desiccator, then accurately weigh 22.1491 g, dissolve, then make volume to 1.0 L in a volumetric flask. Add 2 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to suppress biological activity and store solution in borosilicate glass, preferably in the dark.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sulfur Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Accurately add 10.0, 25.0, 50.0 and 100.0 mL Sulfur Primary Standard (5000 mg/L) to 1.0 L volumetric flasks, each containing 400 mL of 31.5&#8211;33% w/v HCl (or equivalent) and make to volume with deionised water. These S Working Standards have solution concentrations of 50, 125, 250 and 500 mg S/L. Soil equivalent concentrations for a 1:40 soil/solution ratio are 0.20, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00% S. For volumes &#62;10 mL, use a 50 mL burette.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 2 g &#177; 0.01 g of finely ground soil (&#60;0.5 mm, previously dried rapidly at 85&#176;C) into a labelled 250 mL polyethylene bottle. Include a blank sample with each batch of samples. Dispense 80 mL of 4 M HCl into each bottle to make a 1:40 soil suspension, noting that soils high in carbonates can react vigorously with HCl and generate CO<sub>2</sub> gas. Wait until any effervescence subsides before stoppering the bottle. Shake (ideally end-over-end) for 16 h. Remove from tumbler, allow samples to stand for &#8776;30 min, centrifuge for 15 min or filter through thick, medium-speed, high-retention filter paper to obtain particulate-free extracts.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine S<sub>HCl</sub> using ICPAES, guided by details provided in Method 10B3, using an appropriate suite of S Working Standards.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report S<sub>HCl</sub> (ICPAES) as % S on an oven-dry (85&#176;C) basis.</p>
