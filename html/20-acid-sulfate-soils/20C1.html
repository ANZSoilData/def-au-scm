<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter20sec03"></a>20C1 SPOCAS acid trail &#8211; titratable peroxide acidity (TPA) and Net (excess) Acid Neutralising Capacity (a-ANC<sub>E</sub>)</h3>
<p class="para">TPA represents the amount of acid released from the complete oxidation of sulfides (and OM) (combined with any pre-existing TAA), balanced against any buffering provided by acid-neutralising components in the soil (<a href="#ch20ref15">McElnea and Ahern 2004b</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">In some soils, buffering supplied by acid neutralising components may exceed acid generated by oxidation of sulfides, resulting in an &#8216;excess&#8217; acid neutralising capacity. Research conducted by <a href="#ch20ref13">Latham <em>et al.</em> (2000)</a> showed excess carbonate (if present) can interfere with the efficiency of peroxide oxidation. Accordingly, a back titration step with HCl (to pH 4) is included as a precaution, following initial peroxide digestion, as well as a subsequent peroxide digestion step.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soil samples are subjected to extreme oxidising conditions using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Continual application of heat in the presence of peroxide ensures all sulfide is converted to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Titratable acidity is performed on a 1:40 soil/suspension with 1 M KCl to pH 6.5. The suspension is analysed by an auto-titrator (or manually) for pH and acidity.</p>

<p class="para">As for Method 20B1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>2.66 M Potassium Chloride</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 198.81 g of potassium chloride (KCl) and make to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>pH Buffers</em></p>
<p class="para">Obtain commercially or prepare as described in Method 4A1. These should cover the range from pH &#8776;4.0&#8211;9.2.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>30% Hydrogen Peroxide</em></p>
<p class="para">Use only 30%, AR grade hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Check the acidity of each new batch of chemical, which should contain less than the equivalent of 6 mol H<sup>+</sup>/tonne. Adjust, typically with 0.05 M NaOH, to pH 5.5 before use in the &#8216;final oxidation&#8217; step. Handle and store this reagent with caution, as H<sub>2</sub><em>O</em><sub>2</sub> is hazardous. Users should wear PVC gloves and safety glasses when using the chemical. Operations involving H<sub>2</sub><em>O</em><sub>2</sub> <em>should be carried out in a fume cupboard or where there is excellent ventilation.</em></p>
<p class="para1"><em>Copper Chloride Solution (400 mg Cu/L)</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare by dissolving 1.073 g copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) and dilute to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Standard</em> &#8776;<em>0.5 M Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare by adding 50 mL concentrated (&#961; = 1.16 g/mL; 31.5&#8211;33% w/v) HCl to about 400 mL deionised water slowly and with stirring. Cool, then dilute to 1.0 L. If the concentrated HCl has a specified density of around 1.18 g/mL (i.e. &#8776;12.3 M or 38% w/v), then the volume of HCl/L is &#8776;41.71 mL. Standardise against recently standardised &#8776;0.25 M NaOH using an auto-titrator or manually using phenolphthalein as indicator. Make appropriate adjustments to subsequent calculations if not exactly 0.5 M HCl.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>First Action &#8211; all soils</em></p>
<p class="para">Weigh accurately 2.00 g of finely ground soil (previously dried rapidly at 85&#176;C; M<sub>2</sub> g) into a suitably labelled and tared flask (e.g. 250 mL tall-form borosilicate glass beaker) on which the 50 mL level is accurately and clearly marked. Make provision for the inclusion of two blanks in each &#8216;analytical run&#8217;. In a fume cabinet (and wearing safety-glasses, laboratory coat and gloves), add 10 mL of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to each flask and swirl to mix (see Note 1).</p>
<p class="indent-para">After 30 min, add deionised water with further swirling to make the total volume of suspension in the beaker between 45&#8211;50 mL (continue to refer to and follow Note 1).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Place the beaker on a hotplate (or steam bath) located in a fume cupboard for 30 min max and maintain sample and liquid contents at 80&#8211;90&#176;C. If the reaction becomes too violent, remove from heat source and resume only when the violent reaction has subsided. Swirl samples on the hotplate periodically (e.g. every 10 min) and add deionised water as required to maintain volume between 45&#8211;50 mL, and to wash soil residue from the internal sides of the beakers. Allow samples to cool to near room temperature.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add a second 10 mL aliquot of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, waiting 10 min before returning flask to the hotplate for a maximum of 30 min, adopting the procedure outlined above. Allow samples to cool to room temperature and make to 50 mL with deionised water. Measure the suspension pH (pH<sub><span class="smallcaps">OX</span></sub>), while stirring using a suitably calibrated pH meter and electrode. Use the appropriate option from <a href="#ch20tab2">Table 20.2</a>, based on measured pH<sub><span class="smallcaps">OX</span></sub>.</p>

<p class="para">Quantitatively transfer suspensions from the &#8216;First Action&#8217; procedure to titration vessels, helped with deionised water.

<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Expect the initial addition of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to cause an exothermic reaction, which for soils high in reactive pyrite can be quite violent (see <a href="#ch20fig5">Figure 20.5</a>). The addition of deionised water at the first sign of vigorous reaction will help moderate the situation. Additionally, the reaction may become more vigorous with heating. In such cases, remove the relevant flasks from heat, add a small quantity of deionised water, and return the flask to the hot plate or equivalent when the reaction vigour has subsided. It is important to add water to maintain a volume of 45&#8211;50 mL; occasional washing with deionised water helps dissolve salts that adhere to the sides of the container above the liquid line.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para"><a id="page_443"></a>2.&#160;&#160;The HCl-titration is designed to dissolve any reactive carbonate that may be present, as carbonate can interfere with the efficiency of peroxide oxidation. The same titration can also be used to calculate a Net (excess) Acid Neutralising Capacity (a-ANC<sub>E</sub>) of the soil (<a href="#ch20ref15">McElnea and Ahern, 2004b</a>). In so doing, a slow titration to pH 4.0 is required to ensure maximum reactivity of the carbonate, as the dissolution of any solid-phase carbonate into the soil extract/digest can be quite slow. To calculate a-ANC<sub>E</sub>, use the following formula:</p>
