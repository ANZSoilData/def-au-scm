<p class="para">The determination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> is another means by which acid neutralising capacity in soils may be estimated. The method assumes that the extra Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> dissolved during <a id="page_450"></a>peroxide oxidation/digestion compared to that soluble in a 1 M KCl extract (i.e. reacted Ca and Mg) can be used as a surrogate to estimate the acid neutralising capacity of actual and potential ASS (<a href="#ch20ref01">Ahern and McElnea 2004</a>). Relevant terms are:</p>

<p class="indent-para1">Levels of Ca<sub>A</sub> and Mg<sub>A</sub> reflect the amounts of &#8216;insoluble&#8217; Ca and/or Mg carbonates, oxides and hydroxides dissolved by the acid generated by the oxidation of sulfides in peroxide digests. In soils with excess carbonates, Ca<sub>A</sub> and Mg<sub>A</sub> may underestimate actual carbonate contents unless the HCl-back titration procedure in SPOCAS has been performed. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> values can be converted to equivalent acid neutralising capacity (e.g. a-Ca<sub>A</sub>) assuming two moles of neutralising is provided per mole of Ca and Mg, respectively.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">For individual samples, collate relevant input values (Ca<sub>p</sub> and Mg<sub>p</sub>) from Method 20E1 and (Ca<sub>KCl</sub> and Mg<sub>KCl</sub>) from Method 20D1 in units of percent (%) on an oven-dry (85&#176;C) basis. It is assumed that two moles of neutralising is provided per mole of Ca and Mg, respectively. Factors to convert to % CaCO<sub>3</sub> equivalent (oven-dry) are 2.497 and 4.117 for % Ca and % Mg.</p>
