<p class="para">The Cr reduction method (S<sub>CR</sub> method) is based on the conversion of reduced inorganic S to H<sub>2</sub>S by a hot acidic CrCl<sub>2</sub> solution; the evolved H<sub>2</sub>S gas is trapped quantitatively in a Zn acetate solution as solid ZnS. The ZnS is then treated with HCl to release H<sub>2</sub>S into solution, which must then be quickly titrated with I<sub>2</sub> solution to the blue-coloured end point indicated by the reaction of I<sub>2</sub> with starch.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This laboratory method is relatively quick. It reliably measures reduced inorganic S compounds in soils and sediments (<a href="#ch20ref30">Sullivan <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). Those measured are: i) pyrite and other Fe disulfides; ii) elemental S, and iii) acid volatile sulfides (e.g. greigite and mackinawite). The method can be made specific to the Fe disulfide fractions if pre-treatments are used to remove the acid volatile sulfides and elemental S fractions. Importantly, safety protocols must be observed at all times as the method uses and produces toxic chemicals: H<sub>2</sub>S is a flammable gas (flash point of &#8211;82&#176;C, explosion limits of 4.3&#8211;46%, and an auto-ignition temperature of 260&#176;C), and Cr is a potential environmental contaminant.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The S<sub>CR</sub> method is not subject to significant interferences from S in either organic form or inorganic form (e.g. gypsum) as can occur with peroxide oxidisable methods (<a href="#ch20ref29">Sullivan <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). It is arguably the most reliable chemical measure of reduced inorganic S and is particularly suited to reduced and organic soils. The method is recommended for very low sulfidic soils as it has good sensitivity and precision around the action limits that trigger the need for the management of ASS in some Australian states. The reporting limit of the method described is around 0.02% S, with the range of 0&#8211;10% S achieved by varying soil sample weights. <a href="#ch20ref28">Sullivan <em>et al.</em> (1999)</a>, using a 5.0% pyrite standard and a slightly different method, had a pyritic recovery of 98.7%. <a href="#ch20ref08">Canfield <em>et al.</em> (1986)</a> recorded 95.9% recovery, while <a href="#ch20ref22">Raiswell <em>et al.</em> (1988)</a> reported &#8216;close to 100%&#8217; recovery using similar Cr reduction methods.</p>

<p class="para"><em>Zinc Acetate Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 60 g of zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] in 1.5 L of deionised water. Add 200 mL of 28% ammonia solution (NH<sub>4</sub>OH) and make to 2 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Aqueous 6 M Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)</em></p>
<p class="para">With care, dissolve 24.0 g NaOH in a small volume of deionised water then make to 100 mL. Store in a sealed plastic reagent bottle to avoid contact with air.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Standard 0.025 M Sodium Thiosulfate</em></p>
<p class="para">Obtain commercially (or dilute from a more concentrated commercially-prepared standard solution). Alternatively, prepare by dissolving 6.205 g of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O in deionised water (see Note 1), add 1.5 mL of 6 M NaOH, mix well and make to 1.0 L with deionised water in a volumetric flask. This locally-prepared Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> solution is used to standardise fresh I<sub>2</sub> Solution. Standardisation is based on oxidisation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate (maintain a solution pH of &#60;7.6 in the absence of sodium carbonate or equivalent), wherein one equivalent of thiosul-fate corresponds to one equivalent of I<sub>2</sub> (i.e. &#189; I<sub>2</sub>). The chemical reaction is shown in Eqn. 3.</p>

If the concentrated HCl has a specified density of around 1.18 g/mL (i.e. &#8776;12.3 M or 38% w/v), then the volume of HCl required is &#8776;488 mL/L.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Refer to <a href="#ch20fig3">Figure 20.3</a> for a schematic diagram of the distillation apparatus used for the S<sub>CR</sub> method and to <a href="#ch20fig4">Figure 20.4</a> for an example of S<sub>CR</sub> distillation units in use. Multiple distillation units enhance operator efficiency.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The schematic diagram of the S<sub>CR</sub> distillation unit (<a href="#ch20fig3">Figure 20.3</a>) is not to scale. The condenser, for example, should be a minimum length of 400 mm, ideally connected to a refrigerated cooling-water supply. Glass/glass connections should be ground and gas-tight, with PTFE sealing rings recommended. Moreover, all stages of the procedure, including digestion of soil, distillation of H<sub>2</sub>S and subsequent titration to quantify the amount of H<sub>2</sub>S liberated/absorbed must be conducted in a fume cupboard operating (as a minimum) to AS 2243.8 (<a href="#ch20ref06">Anon 2006</a>), since the method uses and produces toxic chemicals. A sensitive H<sub>2</sub>S gas sensor with detectors adjacent to the apparatus and the Zn Acetate Solution should be installed, tested regularly, and used to monitor the local atmosphere during the conduct of this procedure. The fume cabinet must be operating with sufficient efficiency to prevent operator exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S gas in excess of 10 mg/L and much lower if possible.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When the distillation unit/s are set up and tested for efficient and safe operation, weigh 0.5 g (or as guided by Note 3) of finely ground soil (&#60;0.5 mm, previously dried rapidly at 85&#176;C) into a double-neck round-bottom digestion flask. Record the actual sample weight to nearest 0.001 g (W g). Add, with adequate safety precautions (see Note 2), 2.0 g of Cr powder (a calibrated scoop for the batch of Cr powder on hand provides satisfactory accuracy) and 10 mL 95% Ethanol to the digestion flask and swirl to &#8216;wet&#8217; the sample. Include a reagent blank in each batch and subject it to the same procedure as for soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Place the digestion flask in the heating mantle and connect to the condenser. Attach the pressure equalising funnel, making sure the N<sub>2</sub> gas flow arm is facing the condensers and that <a id="page_436"></a>the solution tap is shut. Attach a Pasteur pipette to the outlet tube at the top of the condenser and insert it into a 100 or 150 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 40 mL of Zn Acetate Solution. Ensure there is a flow of cooling-water flow in the condenser.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add 60 mL &#8776;6 M HCl to the glass dispenser in the pressure equalising funnel. Connect the N<sub>2</sub> flow to the pressure equalising funnel and adjust the flow to obtain a bubble rate in the Zn Acetate Solution of about 2&#8211;3 bubbles/sec. Allow the N<sub>2</sub> gas to purge the system for about 3 min. Slowly release the &#8776;6 M HCl from the dispenser into the double-neck flask. Wait for 2 min before turning on the heating mantle and adjust the heat so that a gentle boil is achieved. Check for efficient reflux in the condenser. Allow to digest for 20 min. This part of the procedure must be undertaken in a fume hood to protect the operator from any H<sub>2</sub>S gas hazard.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Subsequently, remove the Erlenmeyer flask and wash any of the ZnS formed and adhering to the Pasteur pipette into the Erlenmeyer flask, using deionised water. Add 20 mL of &#8776;6 M HCl and 1.0 mL of the Starch Indicator Solution to the Zn Acetate Solution and gently mix on a magnetic stirrer (or mix by swirling). Titrate the Zn Acetate trapping solution (now containing ZnS) with the I<sub>2</sub> Solution to the first permanent-blue end point. Record the volume of titrant (A mL). Perform the same titration on the blank sample and record the volume of titrant (B mL). As toxic concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S gas can be evolved after HCl is added to the Zn Acetate trapping solution, at least that part of the procedure should be carried out with caution and with a minimum of delay after the HCl has been added.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following completion of the titration and when the solution is cool, discard the residual solutions (these contain Zn, strongly acidic CrCl<sub>3</sub>, plus soil residue), typically via an interim step of safe, bulk storage prior to later commercial disposal of the hazardous waste. Storage container/s and storage location/s must take account of the occasional possibility of further H<sub>2</sub>S release, particularly when residues from soils very high and very low in S<sub>CR</sub> are combined. It is bad practice to knowingly dispose of heavy metals such as Cr and Zn into the municipal sewerage system.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_437"></a><em>Notes</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Since sodium thiosulfate is deliquescent in moist air, it must first be dried over silica gel contained in a desiccator.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Cr exists in nature at valances from 1 to 6, but most commonly at +3 and +6 oxidation states. Of these, Cr<sup>3+</sup> is the most stable and least toxic to humans. As the metal (non-ionic) and as a fine powder (e.g. &#60;0.5 &#956;m), Cr powder may cause (among others) pneumoconiosis if inhaled across the long term. The fine powder is combustible and gives off irritating or toxic fumes in a fire. Moreover, Cr is a human carcinogen (may cause lung and throat cancer) and a mutagen. (It has an airborne exposure limit of around 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> over 8 h.) Accordingly, a minimum size specification for the Cr powder no finer than 0.5&#8211;1.0 &#956;m is suggested to lessen the chance of operator exposure. In addition: (i) a respirator equipped with a P2 filter should be mandated when handling the Cr powder; (ii) any Cr powder spillages should be removed with a HEPA filter (not a standard shop vacuum cleaner), and (iii) management should consider testing urine Cr levels (these should be &#60;15 &#956;g Cr/L of urine) if any staff over-exposure is suspected.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">3.&#160;&#160;The optimum weight of soil material to digest depends on the expected reduced inorganic S content of the soil, and is a compromise.</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax1">&#8226;&#160;&#160;If too much reduced inorganic S is digested, then too much H<sub>2</sub>S will be supplied to the trapping solution. This may either exceed the capacity of the solution to trap the H<sub>2</sub>S as ZnS (causing an apparent low result) or more likely may require a large volume of I<sub>2</sub> titrant.</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax">&#8226;&#160;&#160;If too little reduced inorganic S is digested, then only very small quantities (if any) of H<sub>2</sub>S will be supplied to the Zn Acetate (trapping) Solution. Samples with very low reduced inorganic S contents will result in very small volumes of I<sub>2</sub> titrant being used, with subsequent poor analytical precision.</p>
<p class="para6b1">If the maximum likely reduced inorganic S content can be assessed (such as by a screening analysis using total S), the following guidelines are useful for determining the optimum sample weights to use. (The actual weight used must be accurately known and recorded.)</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax">&#8226;&#160;&#160;for S<sub>CR</sub> contents &#60;0.5%, use &#8776;3 g of dry, finely ground sample.</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax">&#8226;&#160;&#160;for S<sub>CR</sub> contents of &#8805;0.5 to &#60;1%, use &#8776;0.5 g of dry, finely ground sample.</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax">&#8226;&#160;&#160;for S<sub>CR</sub> contents of &#8805;1% to &#60;3%, use &#8776;0.1 g of dry, finely ground sample.</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax">&#8226;&#160;&#160;for S<sub>CR</sub> contents of &#8805;3%, use &#8776;0.05 g of dry, finely ground sample.</p>
<p class="para6b1">If the likely S<sub>CR</sub> content is not known, then at least 0.5 g of dry powdered sample should be used to ensure adequate analytical precision.</p>
