<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter05sec06"></a>5A4 Chloride &#8211; 1:5 soil/water extract, ICPAES</h3>
<p class="para">Chloride ions in aqueous extracts of soils, when free of interfering particulates, can be measured by ICPAES, if the instrument can operate at a wavelength of 134.72 nm. Spectroflame&#8482; ICP is one that can meet this criterion.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Reagent Water Blank</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 3A1.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Chloride Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 mL contains 2 mg of Cl.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare as for 5A2a.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Chloride Working Standards</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare as for 5A2a to achieve solutions equivalent to soil concentrations of (as required) 10.0, 25.0, 50.0, 125, 250, 375, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 mg Cl/kg of air-dry soil.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_63"></a><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Prepare 1:5 soil/water suspensions as described in Method 3A1. Filter a suitable aliquot for same-day analysis using a &#8804;0.45 &#956;m pre-washed membrane.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Set up the ICPAES instrument according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Specifications may change over time but for a Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> wavelength of 134.724 nm, instrument settings are likely to be: plasma power = 1200 W; nebuliser pressure = &#8776;55 psi; nebuliser flow rate = &#8776;0.9 L/min; auxiliary flow = &#8776;1.15 L/min; coolant flow = &#8776;15 L/min.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Equilibrate the system at constant temperature for &#8776;15&#8211;20 min or until stable performance is achieved. Make other instrumental adjustments in accord with expected Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentration and calibrate the instrument with an appropriate selection of working standard solutions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Analyse the reagent water blank, appropriate calibration solutions and unknown clarified or filtered soil extracts and calculate Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations as described in Method 5A2a.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (mg Cl/kg) on an air-dry basis.</p>
