<p class="para">A potassium chloride solution (1M KCl) is used in this method, with pH determined under conditions similar to those for 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. This method is used in conjunction with Method 4A1 for the estimation of &#916; pH (see Section 4F1). Accordingly, it is particularly applicable to acidic, highly weathered soils dominated by colloids with variable surface charge characteristics.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagent</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>1.0 M Potassium Chloride</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 74.55 g potassium chloride (KCl) and make to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>pH Buffer Solutions</em></p>
<p class="para">pH buffer solutions are as described for Method 4A1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Standardise the pH meter as described in Method 4A1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Proceed as for Method 4B1 except use 1 M KCl when preparing suspension. Complete all measurements on the same day, ideally within 4 h.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report pH (1:5 soil/1 M KCl) on an air-dry basis; abbreviate as pH<sub>KCl</sub>.</p>
