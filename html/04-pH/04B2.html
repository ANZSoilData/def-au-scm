<p class="para">This method provides a convenient laboratory procedure when there is a requirement to report soil pH values from both water and 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. There should be no significant difference between results obtained by this method and results obtained by Method 4B1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagent</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>0.21 M Calcium Chloride</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 30.873 g calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) and make to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>pH Buffer Solutions</em></p>
<p class="para">pH buffer solutions are as described for Method 4A1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Standardise the pH meter as described in Method 4A1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following determination of pH in water (Method 4A1), pipette/dispense 5 mL 0.21 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution to 100 mL of the soil suspension to obtain a 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. Intermittently shake manually or mechanically for 15 min to equilibrate the CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. Allow the suspension to settle for 20&#8211;30 min, position the electrodes in the unstirred supernatant, and record the pH value when a stable reading is obtained. All pH measurements should be completed on the same day, ideally within 4&#8211;6 h.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report pH (1:5 soil/0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>) on an air-dry basis.</p>
