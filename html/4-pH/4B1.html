<p class="para">This method uses dilute calcium chloride (0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>) at a 1:5 soil/solution ratio. Electrodes are positioned in the unstirred supernatant during measurement. Results are commonly from 0.5 to 1.0 pH unit lower than those obtained by Method 4A1 (e.g. <a href="#ch04ref11">Conyers and Davey 1988</a>), although smaller differences are possible when soils contain high levels of soluble salts (naturally and/or from fertiliser additions) and/or when soil colloids exhibit variable surface charge characteristics. Fluctuations in soil soluble salts, due to seasonal conditions and fertiliser inputs, cause less variation of pH values measured in 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> than those measured in water (<a href="#ch04ref30">White 1969</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>0.01 M Calcium Chloride</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 1.470 g calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) and make to 1.0 L with deionised water; this water to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>pH Buffer Solutions</em></p>
<p class="para">pH buffer solutions are as described for Method 4A1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Standardise the pH meter as described in Method 4A1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Proceed as in Method 4A1, except use 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution for preparing the soil suspension instead of deionised water. Allow the suspension to settle for around 20&#8211;30 min and make all measurements on the day of extraction, ideally within 4 h. Position the electrodes in the unstirred supernatant and record the pH value when the meter reading appears steady.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report pH (1:5 soil/0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>) on an air-dry basis.</p>
