<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Following the determination of pH in water, add a weighed quantity of KCl to make the suspension equivalent to 1 M KCl (e.g. 7.46 g/100 mL). Immediately restopper and mechanically shake, end-over-end, at 25&#176;C in a closed system for 1 h. Allow around 20&#8211;30 min for the soil to settle, then measure pH as described in Method 4B1, completing all measurements within 4&#8211;6 h.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report pH<sub>KCl</sub> on an air-dry basis.</p>
