<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter04sec02"></a>4A2 pH of 1:1 soil/water suspension</h3>
<p class="para">This method is similar to Method 4A1, except it is based on a 1:1 soil/water suspension. The test is used in the Australian Soil Classification (Isbell 1998) to identify sulfuric minerals. Specifically, a soil contains sulfuric material when pH (1:1 soil/water) is below 4 by this method, when measured in dry season (oxidised) conditions. Supporting field evidence that low pH is caused by oxidation of sulfides is one of the following: (i) yellow mottles and coatings of jarosite (hue of 2.5Y or more yellow, with chroma of above 6), and (ii) underlying sulfidic material.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para">All reagents, including pH buffer solutions, are as described for Method 4A1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">For example, weigh 50 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a suitable bottle or jar and add 50 mL deionised water. Mechanically shake, end-over-end, at 25&#176;C in a closed system for 1 h. Check the glass and reference electrodes and calibrate the pH meter as described in Method 4A1. Make all measurements on the day of extraction, ideally within 4 h. Record the pH value obtained when the meter appears steady while the suspension is being mechanically stirred. Replicate determinations should give results within 0.1 pH unit.</p>
