<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter04sec15"></a>4F1 &#916; pH</h3>
<p class="para">This calculation provides some indication of the sign of the electrical charge currently dominant in the soil and applies particularly to acidic soils with variable-charge characteristics (<a href="#ch04ref28">Uehara and Gillman 1981</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="center-para">&#916; pH = [pH<sub>KCl</sub> &#8211; pH<sub>w</sub>]</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_46"></a>where pH<sub>KCl</sub> refers to Method 4C1, 4C2, 4C3 or 4C4 and pH<sub>w</sub> refers to Method 4A1</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report &#916; pH, including the &#8211;ive or +ive sign.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Interpretation</em></h3>
<p class="para">If &#916; pH is positive, the soil pH is probably less than the point of zero charge (pH<sub>0</sub>) and the soil carries a net positive surface charge. When &#916; pH is negative, the soil is above pH<sub>0</sub> and carries a net negative surface charge. Dominance of a soil by variable-charge colloids can generally be assumed when &#916; pH is a small negative (less than &#8211;0.5), zero, or positive value.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When &#916; pH has a large negative value, nothing can be deduced about whether the surface charge is permanent or variable. Acid soils with &#916; pH values near zero or positive can be expected to contain low levels of extractable Al (<a href="#ch04ref27">Uehara and Gillman 1980</a>) but are likely to be calcium deficient.</p>
