<p class="para">Dumas high-temperature combustion technology has advantages for the measurement of TSN for several reasons (<a href="#ch07ref43">McGill and Figueiredo 1993</a>). For example, all forms of soil N can be included without pre-treatments; it can be adapted for <sup>15</sup>N tracer studies when linked to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer; it eliminates the need for strong-acid digestions; requires <a id="page_111"></a>little laboratory bench space, and has multi-element capability. Disadvantages include occasionally lower apparent TSN concentrations in soils with high levels of fixed NH<sub>4</sub>-N, and the reverse (due to incomplete combustion resulting in the formation of methane rather than CO<sub>2</sub>) in some organic-rich soils (<a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner 1996</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nowadays, several manufacturers produce high-temperature combustion analysers suited to the measurement of TSN across a range of concentrations (e.g. 0.02 to &#62;0.5% N). Typically, the dry, finely-ground sample is subjected to high-temperature combustion (e.g. 900&#8211;1350&#176;C) in a stream of purifed O<sub>2</sub>. An aliquot of the gases produced by combustion is carried by helium gas to a thermal conductivity cell for measurement of any N<sub>2</sub> generated, a process typically taking 3&#8211;5 min. A heated Cu catalyst reduces NO<sub>x</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>. The example methodology described is based on the automated LECO&#8482; CNS 2000 analyser.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm), air-dry (40&#176;C) soil samples are required. These are accurately weighed into ceramic boats and then combusted. Water and CO<sub>2</sub> are subsequently absorbed in an anhydrone tube, leaving the N<sub>2</sub> to be measured by thermal conductivity. Practical quantitation limits depend on the amount of sample used but are typically around 0.01&#8211;0.02% N. At all times, workplace health and safety procedures need to be in place and followed, given the use of high temperature combustion and pressurised O<sub>2</sub> gas. Have a fire blanket and an appropriate fire extinguisher close to hand.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Apparatus</em></h3>
<p class="para">LECO&#8482; CNS&#8211;2000 analyzer or equivalent, plus essential gases and other accessories.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid Reference Standard (EDTA)</em></p>
<p class="para">Use dry (105&#176;C for 2 h), high-grade EDTA (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), calibrated against EDTA certified by the instrument manufacturer. When fully dry, this contains 9.586% N.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Other Reagents</em></p>
<p class="para">Use those specified by the instrument manufacturer.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Set up and maintain the high-temperature combustion analyser in accord with the manufacturer&#8217;s Operation and Procedures&#8217; Manual. This includes performing door-maintenance and a combustion-leak check.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Run three separate ceramic &#8216;boats&#8217; of EDTA Reference Standard (9.586% N) to stabilise the detectors, noting that irritating, toxic NO<sub>x</sub> is released when EDTA is heated to its decomposition temperature of 240&#176;C. Next combust three empty ceramic &#8216;boats&#8217; as blanks, using 0.200 g as the weight, to set the instrument blank from these results. Follow this by weighing into ceramic &#8216;boats&#8217; and analysing three separate replications of EDTA Reference Standard. Use the two closest results to perform a drift correction. Confirm the instrument setup and calibration by analysing at least one internal LCS for quality assurance purposes, using a weight between 0.3 and 0.75 g depending on the expected concentration.</p>
<p class="indent-para">If the LCS sample/s test within its/their accepted concentration/s, proceed to analyse unknown samples. Should the analyser be &#8216;out-of-range&#8217;, analyse another EDTA Reference Standard portion of known weight. Again perform a drift correction. Follow this with the reanalysis of another portion of the LCS sample/s. If the expected result/s is/are still out of specification, the instrument, gas lines and detectors should be double-checked before proceeding any further (see Note 1).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_112"></a>When optimum analytical performance specifications are confirmed, prepare a known weight (e.g. 0.5&#8211;0.75 g of finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm) air-dry soil) and proceed to analyse all samples. If results are &#8216;out-of-range&#8217;, adjust sample weights as necessary. Include a LCS, followed by an EDTA Reference Standard portion of known weight to check instrumental drift about every 25 samples. Finally, include a further LCS and an EDTA Reference Standard portion of known weight at the end of the samples&#8217; &#8216;run&#8217;, then finish with 2 blanks to enable the gas blank to be reset if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent-para">At the end of the run, go back and check that the LCS values are within their accepted range. If not, use the next measured EDTA Reference Standard value to &#8216;drift correct&#8217;, then recalculate the results. In general, recalculate the results halfway back to the last in-range LCS.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="center-para">TSN(%N) = [a &#215; MF]</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">where:</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">a = N concentration in air-dry sample (%N)</p>
<p class="indent-para">MF = air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio</p>
<p class="indent-para1a">Report TSN (%) on an oven-dry basis (see Note 2).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Notes</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;<a href="#ch07ref68">Tiessen and Moir (1993)</a> warn that in routine use at high temperatures, hairline cracks may form in the ceramic tube of the combustion furnace, causing leaks and consequential low recoveries.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;If C and N are the only tests to be undertaken, it is acceptable to place the samples in a small oven for 1 h at 105&#176;C prior to analysis, and weigh the sample directly from the oven. (This is <em>in lieu</em> of analysing air-dry samples and correcting the results using the relevant air-dry to oven-dry moisture ratio &#8211; the MF). Refer to Method 2A1 for further guidance on air-dry to oven-dry moisture calculation.</p>
