<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec23"></a>7C2a Mineral-N &#8211; 2 M KCl, automated colour, continuous segmented flow</h3>
<p class="para">The soil extraction component of this method, including conditions of storage of filtered and unfiltered 2 M KCl soil extracts, is identical to that of Method 7C1. Mineral-N fractions in the clarified soil extract are then determined by automated colorimetric procedures. SFA systems typically run faster than similar FIA systems operating at high sensitivity.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ammonium ions are measured by a modified Berthelot indophenol reaction (<a href="#ch07ref63">Searle 1984</a>) similar to that of Method 7A2a. Ammonia reacts with hypochlorite ions that are generated <em>in situ</em> by alkaline hydrolysis of sodium dichloroisocyanurate. The monochloramine formed then reacts with salicylate ions in the presence of sodium nitroprusside to form a blue <a id="page_127"></a>indophenol-type compound that absorbs strongly at 660 nm. A citrate buffer is employed to chelate metals that would otherwise form insoluble hydroxides or carbonates.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In the NO<sub>3</sub>-N procedure, NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211; is reduced to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> by hydrazine in the presence of CuSO<sub>4</sub> in a buffered alkaline solution at 45&#176;C, and the NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> produced, along with any NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> already present in the soil extract, is determined by a modified Griess-Ilosay method (<a href="#ch07ref09">Best 1976</a>). A description of this reaction is contained in the general review of the determination of inorganic forms of N given by <a href="#ch07ref48">Mulvaney (1996)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The analytical finish, with extended range detectors, is capable of analysing up to 100 mg/kg of N as NH<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub>-N in undiluted extracts. Since levels of NO<sub>2</sub>-N are normally insignificant in agricultural soils, it is usual to express NO<sub>3</sub>-N + NO<sub>2</sub>-N as NO<sub>3</sub>-N, although these can be expressed separately if necessary.</p>
