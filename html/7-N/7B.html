<p class="para">One of the attractions of using water as an extractant for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in soils is that the same extract can also be used to measure soil EC (Method 3A1), soil pH (Method 4A1) and water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (Method 5). Also, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in soil is mostly water-soluble and is weakly retained or not retained by soil colloids in all but some highly weathered soils. Moreover, water is a cheap extractant for routine soil testing services. Aqueous salt solutions such as 2 M KCl are preferred as an extractant for precise studies and when soils are known to have a significant anion exchange capacity. Soil concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub>-N can range from negligible to &#62;300 mg N/kg (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref55">Rayment 1994</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Three methods for determining water-soluble nitrate-N have 7B codes. All have the same method of extraction but different analytical finishes; viz., automated colour SFA, FIA and IC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">International and local experience is that variations due to method of determination are relatively minor. Of greater importance are field sampling techniques and sample-transport conditions. This is because NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> can move with water in or on the soil, and may accumulate at different soil depths or wash from the site. In addition, care is necessary to minimise the possibility of N transformations and additions during transport to the laboratory, during sample preparation, and while air drying (&#8804;40&#8211;45&#176;C) and subsequent milling.</p>
