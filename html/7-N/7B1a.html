<p class="para">This method has relevance to soil mineral-N fertility, provided field-moist samples are kept cool (refrigerate if possible) between sampling and the commencement of air drying. Nitrates (and any NO<sub>2</sub>-N present) are obtained for analysis after filtration or centrifugation of an aliquot of the 1:5 soil/water suspension.</p>
<p class="indent-para">SFA is one of the technologies suited to the measurement of NO<sub>3</sub>-N in these extracts. One example is based on AutoAnalyzer I/II technology, although it is recognised that improvements in system performance are ongoing, as mentioned in the preamble to Method 7A2a. Specifically, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in the extract is reduced to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> with hydrazine (or via a cadmium reduction column) and the NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentration determined by an automated colorimetric procedure (Griess-Ilosvay reaction) that absorbs strongly at 540 nm. Generally, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> is not present <a id="page_115"></a>in significant concentrations and is ignored. In special cases where NO<sub>2</sub>-N is suspected and field-moist soil is available for extraction, the analysis may be conducted without the reduction step to determine NO<sub>2</sub>-N concentration. Nitrate-N is then obtained by difference.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Reducing substances (e.g. ascorbates) and oxidising agents (e.g. hypochlorite) can interfere with the determination. An alum&#8211;NaCl solution is introduced prior to dialysis to enhance the movement of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> across the dialyser membrane (G.A. Barry and G.F. Haydon, unpublished data). The auto-analyser manifold in <a href="#ch7fig7">Figure 7.7</a> permits simultaneous determination of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in aqueous soil extracts (if required).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Continuous flow instrumentation uses a peristaltic pump to draw sample extracts from the sampler into a manifold designed to mix the samples with reagents that are being pumped at predetermined flow rates, and on eventually to the colorimeter. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions from the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the optional flow diagrams shown in <a href="#ch7fig7">Figures 7.7</a> and <a href="#ch7fig8">7.8</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Prepare 1:5 soil/water suspensions as described in Method 3A1. Filter or centrifuge a suitable aliquot for automated colour segmented flow analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ensure individual components of the SFA manifold of choice are connected as detailed on the relevant flow sheet (<a href="#ch7fig7">Figure 7.7</a> or <a href="#ch7fig8">Figure 7.8</a>). Instrument selections and settings should be in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. The manifold of <a href="#ch7fig7">Figure 7.7</a> is designed for simultaneous measurement of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>. If only NO<sub>3</sub>-N is required, deionised water can be pumped through tubes allocated for Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> reagents. &#8216;Condition&#8217; the relevant manifold before use, make a final check on dialyser condition and instrument settings, then determine NO<sub>3</sub>-N in soil extracts directly from working standards run on commencement and as required throughout the batch of unknowns. Use deionised water containing &#8776;1.0 mL/L Brij 35 as the sampler/probe wash solution. Use deionised water for the dilution of extracts of high NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentration.</p>
