<p class="para">The equipment and issues relevant to the analysis of anions in aqueous extracts of soils by IC are detailed in the soil Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> chapter, particularly Methods 5A3a and 5A3b. The only sample preparation required after soil extraction is the removal of particulate matter &#62;0.20 &#956;m by filtration or centrifugation and dilution if EC levels by Method 3A1 are high.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This technology for NO<sub>3</sub>-N can also determine NO<sub>2</sub>-N in aqueous extracts of soil but the results have little value when performed on air-dry samples. Other anions measured sequentially in the same sample at the mg/L concentration range or lower include Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub>-P and SO<sub>4</sub>-S (<a href="#ch07ref50">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> 1984</a>). These analyses can be completed sequentially within 30 min or less, using a few mL of extract. As the two IC technologies (chemical suppression of eluent conductivity and single-column with electronic suppression of eluent conductivity) give very similar results, only one method code has been allocated.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Reagent Water</em></p>
<p class="para">Deionised or distilled water, free of the anions of interest and containing no particles &#62;0.20 &#956;m.</p>

<p class="para">See Methods 5A3a and 5A3b.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_122"></a><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Prepare 1:5 soil/water suspensions as described in Method 3A1. Filter (&#60;0.20 &#956;m) an aliquot for IC analysis; see Note 1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ensure components of the IC analyzer are operating within specification. Equilibrate and determine the retention time, guided by procedures outlined in Methods 5A3a or 5A3b. The order of anions is always F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>. Analyse the reagent water blank and the High-, Intermediate- and Low-range Calibration Solutions by injecting 2&#8211;3 mL aliquots. Prepare calibration curves for NO<sub>3</sub>-N (and all other anions of interest) by plotting peak height (usually as &#956;S/cm) or peak area &#8211; from the chromatogram &#8211; against the concentrations of the anion calibration solutions. Note that a single standard calibration is possible if linearity can be established for a known detector setting. In such cases, determine the calibration factor F from peak height or area and the retention time. A calibration curve is preferred, however, when the relationship is non-linear (<a href="#ch07ref06">APHA 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next inject a known volume of the filtered soil/water extract (same volume as used for the calibration solution/s). Record the ion chromatogram, evaluate peak height or peak area as required for comparison with the relevant calibration curve, and determine the anion concentration (NO<sub>3</sub>-N in this case), initially as mg/L. Multiply by 5 to convert to mg/kg air-dry soil. (Another sample can be injected after the last peak (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>) has appeared and the conductivity signal has returned to base line.) To avoid interference when NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> or other anions are present at elevated concentrations, causing overlap of neighbouring anion species, minimise by sample dilution with Reagent Water, and adjust for the dilution in the final calculation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When the calibration is known to be linear, the following equation can be used to calculate the anion concentration:</p>
<p class="center-para">Anion concentration (mg/kg air dry soil) = [H &#215; F &#215; D &#215; 5]</p>
<p class="indent-para">where</p>
<p class="indent-para">H = peak height or area</p>
<p class="indent-para">F = response factor or concentration of standard/height (or area) of standard</p>
<p class="indent-para">D = dilution factor for those samples requiring dilution, and</p>
<p class="indent-para">5 accounts for the 1:5 soil/solution ratio.</p>
<p class="indent-para1a">Report NO<sub>3</sub>-N (mg N/kg) on an air-dry basis.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Same-day analysis is preferred to limit the possibility of biological change: store filtered samples at 4&#176;C only if same-day analysis is not possible.</p>
