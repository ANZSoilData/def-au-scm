<p class="para">IR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is an emerging, non-destructive, analytical technology that relies on statistical relationships between IR soil spectra and results obtained from &#8216;conventional&#8217; measurements, in this case for TSN. The instrumentation typically has a small laboratory foot-print (<a href="#ch7fig6">Figure 7.6</a>). For more details on the technology, see <a href="#ch07ref29">Janik <em>et al.</em> (1998)</a>, <a href="#ch07ref64">Shepherd and Walsh (2002)</a>, plus Method 6B4. The same issues and opportunities applicable to the measurement of soil C by IR apply to soil N.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch07ref40">Malley and Martin (2004)</a> have summarised multiple examples of the use of NIR spectroscopy for TSN, incuding goodness-of-fits for &#8216;training-set&#8217; data from conventional methodologies (r<sup>2</sup> values 0.53&#8211;0.96; median = 0.85). Methods for TSN using both NIR and MIR are provided. Sequential scans typically take around 1&#8211;2 min/sample, most commonly 1 min. The soils should be &#8776;40&#176;C air-dry and &#60;0.5 mm. This technology is also suited to predicting the concentrations of other chemical and physical properties of soils.</p>
