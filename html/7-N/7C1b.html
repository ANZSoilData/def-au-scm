<p class="para">Following removal of NH<sub>4</sub>-N as described in 7C1a, add 0.2 g of Devarda&#8217;s alloy (0.35 g if not ball-milled; see Notes 4 and 5) rapidly through a dry powder funnel that reaches into flask. It is convenient to use a distillation flask fitted with a side-arm, complete with a ground glass joint to facilitate this operation. The stem of the dry-powder funnel should extend at least 1 cm below base of the ground glass joint.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Immediately reseal flask and proceed to determine the NH<sub>4</sub>-N liberated following steam distillation as described in 7C1a.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="para">For a Y mL aliquot of a 10 g/100 mL air-dry soil extract and 0.01 M HCl:</p>
<p class="center-para">NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211;N + NO<sub>2</sub>&#8211;N = [(sample titre &#8211; blank titre) &#215; Y &#215; 100 &#215; 0.1401]mg N/kg</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_125"></a>Report NO<sub>3</sub>-N + NO<sub>2</sub>-N (mg N/kg) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Notes for 7C1 Methods</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Make periodic checks on recovery of the various mineral-N components by substituting relevant aliquots of the two N standard solutions, diluted as necessary with 2 M KCl extracting solution.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Field extraction or use of field-moist soil is necessary for accurate estimates of NO<sub>2</sub>-N and are often preferred for precise studies of soil mineral-N content. Make due allowances for a variable soil/solution ratio and for the additional moisture added.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">3.&#160;&#160;Unfiltered soil extracts based on 2 M KCl can be stored safely up to 24 h at 25&#176;C and for up to 48 h at 4&#176;C. Filtered extracts can be stored for at least 45 days at 25&#176;C and for up to 4 months at &#8804;4&#176;C.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">4.&#160;&#160;It is not necessary to use accurately weighed amounts of MgO and Devarda&#8217;s alloy. Calibrated glass or stainless steel scoops are satisfactory.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">5.&#160;&#160;<a href="#ch07ref10">Best and Craswell (1985)</a> have shown that 2 M KCl soil extracts containing in excess of 0.02 M Mg can interfere in the determination of NO<sub>3</sub>-N based on use of Devarda&#8217;s alloy and subsequent steam distillation. Recoveries can be as low as 25%. The 1:10 soil/solution ratio used in this method overcame the interference on all soils tested. For narrow soil/solution ratios, as might occur with field extraction of moist soil, 0.4 g of Devarda&#8217;s alloy for a 20 mL aliquot of the 2 M KCl soil extract was always sufficient to achieve full recoveries.</p>
