<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec27"></a>7D1b Potentially mineralisable N, hot-KCl extraction (PMN<sub>KCl</sub>) &#8211; automated colour, FIA</h3>
<p class="para">This method is identical to Method 7D1a, except that it uses an FIA finish rather than an automated colour, continuous segmented flow finish.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_136"></a><em>Apparatus</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>FIA Instrumentation</em></p>
<p class="para">See Methods 7A2b, 7B1b and 7C2b, and as guided by the system&#8217;s manufacturer.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>2 M KCl Extracting Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 7C1. Ensure any stored solution is well stoppered to prevent NH<sub>3</sub> absorption from the laboratory environment.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Other Reagents</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare as for Method 7C2b &#8211; NH<sub>4</sub>-N only.</p>
<p class="para1">PMN<sub>KCl</sub> <em>(Ammonium) Standard Solutions</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare as for Method 7D1a.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soil extraction and preparation of extracts for analysis, commencing with 3.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) is exactly as for Method 7D1a. Next analyse the clarified extracts by FIA, guided by Method 7C2b, except that the effective soil/extract ratio is 1:16.67 rather than 1:10.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Calculation and Reporting of PMN<sub>KCl</sub></h3>
<p class="para">Net PMN<sub>KCl</sub> = Measured PMN<sub>KCl</sub> &#8211; Mineral N from Method 7C2a/b (or equivalent), with all expressed as mg N/kg, air-dry.</p>
