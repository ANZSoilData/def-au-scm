<p class="para">When micro-organisms decompose SOM, N is &#8216;mineralised&#8217;. How much N is released and when this release occurs determines whether it will become available for plant growth and/or represent a risk of loss to the environment in humid regions. These questions have stimulated development of laboratory methods for PMN (<a href="#ch07ref72">Walley and Yates 2002</a>; <a href="#ch07ref75">Wang <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two laboratory-based methods for PMN are included. The first (7D1), which has several optional analytical finishes, is a chemical procedure that utilises hot-KCl extraction of air-dry samples. Extraction time and temperature are 95&#176;C for 16 h, as most NH<sub>4</sub>-N is expected to be released under these conditions (<a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The second PMN method (7D2) utilises anaerobic incubation in the laboratory for seven days, based broadly on the methods of <a href="#ch07ref76">Waring and Bremner (1964)</a> and <a href="#ch07ref32">Keeney and Bremner (1966)</a>. The method requires fresh, field-moist soil as a starting point (air-dried soils are unsuitable).</p>
