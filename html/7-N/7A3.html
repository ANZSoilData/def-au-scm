<p class="para">The salicylic modification to ensure recovery of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N during Kjeldahl digestion was introduced by <a href="#ch07ref19">Cope (1916)</a>. Nitro-compounds are initially formed when soils containing NO<sub>3</sub>-N react with salicylic acid/H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. These nitro-compounds are subsequently reduced to corresponding amino compounds by heating and mixing with sodium thiosulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O), prior to conventional Kjeldahl digestion/distillation.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch07ref16">Bremner and Mulvaney (1982)</a> reported similar recoveries of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N during Kjeldahl digestion to those obtained by a permanganate-reduced iron procedure (not described). Use of purified KNO<sub>3</sub> and NaNO<sub>3</sub> standard solutions, however, are recommended as a check on recoveries.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_109"></a>Soils justifying use of this method include those that have recently received significant inputs of N fertiliser and/or sewage sludge, feed-lot manure and the like. Soils used repeatedly for vegetable production are also eligible, because of likely elevated soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref55">Rayment 1994</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Digest and distil a reagent blank with each batch of assays. Weigh 0.200 g of ground (&#60;0.5 mm) air-dry soil into a Kjeldahl flask (see Note 1, Method 7A1). Add 8.0 mL Sulfuric&#8211;salicylic Acid Digest Mixture and allow to stand with occasional shaking for 1 h. Stopper digestion flask (stopper should be contamination free) and leave overnight.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next day, add 0.5 g Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O through a long-neck funnel and heat gently for about 5 min. Remove from heat and when cool, add 2.2 g catalyst mixture (or the equivalent in tablet form) and complete both digestion and distillation as for Method 7A1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>
<p class="para">For a 0.200 g air-dry sample and 0.010 M HCl on the total digest:</p>
<p class="center-para">%TSN = [(sampletitre &#8211; blank titre) &#215; 0.07]</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report TSN (%) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
