<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec12"></a>7B1b Water-soluble nitrate-N &#8211; automated colour, FIA</h3>
<p class="para">Technical aspects of FIA technology are covered in earlier preambles. Specifically, water-soluble inorganic NO<sub>3</sub>-N is extracted from soils off-line, as described in 7B1a. The FIA &#8216;finish&#8217; is based on the Griess-Ilosvay reaction for NO<sub>2</sub>-N (if present) and NO<sub>3</sub>-N, the latter following automated reduction to NO<sub>2</sub>-N in a copperised-cadmium column (Cd-Cu reduction column). The NO<sub>2</sub>-N is then determined by diazotising with sulfanilamide and by coupling with N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride. The resulting water-soluble dye has a magenta colour that absorbs strongly at 520&#8211;540 nm. The FIA analytical finish is similar to that described by <a href="#ch07ref36">Knepel (2002)</a>, plus Method 6M2a of <a href="#ch07ref69a">USDA-NSSC (1996)</a> and <a href="#ch07ref70">US-EPA (2002)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch07ref24">Gal <em>et al.</em> (2004)</a> found the Cd-Cu reduction step was critical, inclusive of the way the reductor material was prepared, the chemical conditions under which reduction takes place <a id="page_118"></a>(e.g. pH and concentration of complexing agents) and poisoning of the Cd-Cu reduction surface by sample constituents. They identified the concomitant reduction of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> as a potential problem causing loss of pH control (due to <em>in-situ</em> generation of hydroxide). De-oxygenation of the carrier solution can minimise this problem, with the additional advantages of increasing the lifetime of the reductor column and significantly reducing the concentration of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in the waste stream.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Apparatus</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>FIA instrumentation</em> As with segmented flow instrumentation, the analyst must be guided by the operational instructions provided by the FIA manufacturer. This could require minor changes to the specified reagents and standard solution concentrations.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Lachat&#8482; is one such system (<a href="#ch07ref36">Knepel 2002</a>). Key components include an autosampler, a reagent pump, a &#8216;System Unit&#8217;, a Windows&#8482;-compatible computer with suitable FIA software, and a printer. The System needs to be configured for performing FIA with photometric detection. The &#8216;flow&#8217; is not segmented.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Soil Extraction</em></p>
<p class="para">Prepare 1:5 soil/water suspensions as described in Method 3A1. Filter or centrifuge a suitable aliquot for determination by FIA.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Preparing the Cadmium&#8211;Copper Reduction Column</em></p>
<p class="para">Cd-Cu reduction columns are available prepacked from FIA instrument manufacturers. If in-house preparation is preferred, proceed (Lachat, and <a href="#ch07ref70">US-EPA 2002</a>) as follows.</p>
<p class="parab">Cadmium Preparation and Copperisation</p>
<p class="parab">Place 10&#8211;20 g of coarse Cd granules in a 250 mL borosilicate beaker. Wash with 50 mL of acetone, then with de-oxygenated deionised water, then with two &#215; 50 mL portions of 1 M HCl, then rinse with de-oxygenated deionised water. Add a 100 mL portion of 2% CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O Solution to the now treated coarse Cd granules. Swirl for about 5 min, <a id="page_120"></a>then decant the liquid and repeat with a fresh 100 mL portion of the 2% CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O Solution. Continue this process until the blue aqueous Cu<sup>2+</sup> colour persists. Decant and wash with at least five portions of Ammonium Chloride Buffer to remove colloidal Cu. The &#8216;reduced&#8217; coarse Cd should be black or dark grey. The now copperised-Cd granules may be stored in a stoppered bottle under Ammonium Chloride Buffer.</p>
<p class="paraz">Packing the Copperised&#8211;Cadmium Reduction Column</p>
<p class="parab">As a precaution, wear gloves and do all Cd transfers over a tray or beaker. Also, clamp the empty Cd-Cu reduction column upright so hands are free. Unscrew one of the coloured fittings from an end of the column, and pull out and save the foam plug. The column and threads are glass so take care not to break or chip them. Fasten this fitting up higher than the open end of the column and completely fill the Cd-Cu reduction column, attached fittings, and tubing with Ammonium Chloride Buffer. Scoop up prepared Cd-Cu granules with a spatula and pour them into the top of the filled column so that they sink down to the base of the column. Continue pouring the Cd-Cu granules in while tapping the column carefully with a screwdriver handle (or similar) to dislodge any air bubbles and to prevent gaps in the Cd-Cu filling. When the Cd-Cu granules reach about 5 mm from the open end of the column, push in the foam plug and screw on the top fitting. Rinse the outside of the column with deionised water. If air remains in the column or is introduced accidentally, connect the column into the manifold, turn the pump on maximum, and tap firmly with a screwdriver handle (or similar), working up the column until all air is removed.</p>
<p class="paraz">Cd&#8211;Cu Reducing Column Insertion Procedure</p>
<p class="parab">Before inserting the column, pump all reagents into the FIA manifold then turn off the pump. On the column, disconnect the centre tubing from one of the union connectors and immediately connect to the outlet tubing of the buffer mixing coil. Next connect the open tubing on the column to the T fitting where the colour reagent is added. <em>(Do not let air enter the recharged Cd&#8211;Cu reducing column.)</em> Return the pump to its normal speed, noting that the direction of reagent flow through the Cd-Cu reducing column is not relevant.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>FIA Analysis</em></p>
<p class="para">Ensure individual components of the FIA system are connected as specified by the instrument&#8217;s manufacturer and that the Cd-Cu reducing column is inserted correctly and is working well. Fresh columns should remain effective for 500&#8211;600 samples, provided no air enters the system. An example FIA manifold is shown in <a href="#ch7fig9">Figure 7.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Transfer the particulate-free, aqueous extracts into tubes for FIA analysis. Same-day measurement is preferred to limit the possibility of biological change: store filtered samples at 4&#176;C only if same-day analysis is not possible. Long storage of these extracts is not recommended and aqueous extracts must not be preserved with mercuric chloride, as this degrades the Cd-Cu reducing column (<a href="#ch07ref36">Knepel 2002</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Select appropriate concentrations of Nitrate Working Standards and transfer aliquots into similar tubes as used for unknown samples, then load the FIA sampler. Refer to the operating and software reference manuals for the FIA instrument for set-up and operational instructions for this method and activate. Subsequently, the FIA baseline should be smooth and at zero absorbance. Scatter is indicative of air bubbles and irregular reagent flow. Also observe for any inappropriate back pressure in manifold tubing and correct if necessary.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Finally, determine NO<sub>3</sub>-N in soil extracts directly from working standards run on commencement and as required throughout the batch of extracts. Use de-oxygenated deionised water as the sampler wash solution (Probe rinse) and for the dilution of extracts of high NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentration.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report NO<sub>3</sub>-N (mg N/kg) on an air-dry basis.</p>
