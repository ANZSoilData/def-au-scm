<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter14sec20"></a>14G2a Fluoride<sub>/SE</sub> &#8211; IC (chemical suppression of eluent conductivity)</h3>
<p class="para">Fluoride and other anions including Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub>-S, NO<sub>3</sub>-N and PO<sub>4</sub>-P, are included in the analytical suite described in more detail in Methods 5A3a and 14E2a. As earlier mentioned (see <a href="#ch14ref06">APHA-AWWA-WEF 2005c</a>), this IC technology is not recommended for F<sup>&#8211;</sup> at very low concentrations and in unknown matrices, the latter for reasons including possible interference from simple organic acids (formic, carbonic, etc) that elute close to F<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Bromates and chlorates may also interfere. There are &#8216;work-arounds&#8217; using special columns, dilute eluent or gradient elution with NaOH. IC analyses can be completed sequentially within 30 min or less using a few mL of extract. Alternative IC technology, based on a single-column with electronic suppression of eluent conductivity, is provided as Method 14G2b.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Fluoride Primary Standard</em></p>
<p class="para">1 L contains 1000 mg of F.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 2.2101 g anhydrous sodium fluoride (NaF; dry in a desiccator) in Reagent Water and make to 1.0 L in a volumetric flask. This solution is stable for at least one month when stored at &#8776;4&#176;C.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_287"></a><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Double check that with the column/eluent combination selected, F ion &#8216;peaks&#8217; do not exhibit &#8216;water dip&#8217;; i.e. F<sup>&#8211;</sup> peaks should be clearly visible above the reagent baseline, even at low concentrations. When confirmed, analyse an aliquot of the SE by this IC technology as outlined in Method 14E2a. No particles in the SE should exceed 0.20 &#956;m.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report F<sup>&#8211;</sup><sub>/SE</sub> (mg/L) with relevant method codes, or divide by 18.998 to convert to cmol<sub>c</sub>F/L.</p>
