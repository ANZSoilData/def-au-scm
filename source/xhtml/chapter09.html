<h2 class="h2a">Phosphorus</h2>
<p class="para">Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient, mostly obtained by plants from soil. Unfortunately, few soils are able to continuously meet the P requirements of productive plants, without inputs of phosphatic fertilisers, manures, biosolids and the like. Great progress towards understanding the chemistry and biochemistry of soil and plant P has helped answer questions on the extent of soil P reserves and whether or not a response by plants to P applications might be expected. This chapter draws on that understanding, noting the four key P supply factors are quantity, intensity, rate and capacity.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The most abundant P mineral is apatite [Ca<sub>5</sub>(F, Cl, OH)(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>], which has a structure that tolerates numerous cationic replacements for Ca and several anionic replacements for phosphate. In addition, P often occurs in silicate minerals due to isomorphous replacement of Si<sup>4&#43;</sup> by P<sup>5&#43;</sup> in silicate (SiO<sub>4</sub>) tetrahedra. The low solubilities of orthophosphates of Ca, Fe, Al and Pb greatly influence the reactivity of P in natural systems and soils. Free PO<sub>4</sub> ions in soils from natural weathering and from fertilisers are rapidly adsorbed onto the surface of most soils via several mechanisms that commonly involve chemical reactions with Fe, Al, Ca and Mg (see <a href="#ch9tab1">Table 9.1</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref83">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). P is non-volatile at normal soil temperatures, while the likelihood of P leaching is low in soils with a capacity to remove it from soil solution by fixation or precipitation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Total Soil P</em></h3>
<p class="para">Total P (TP) concentrations in Australian soils are low by world standards (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref51">Moody and Bolland 1999</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref04">Anon 2001</a>). This is supported by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref57">Norrish and Rosser (1983)</a>, who provided summary data on TP concentrations in a selection of Australian soils. Median concentrations of 0.035 and 0.025% P were obtained from their tabulated data for typical surface and sub-soils, respectively. The concentration range for surface soils was 0.011&#8211;0.169% P. Modelled estimates by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref04">Anon (2001)</a> found the majority of Australian soils associated with all types of land uses, with the exception of irrigated cropping soils, contained &#60;0.02% of TP. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref04">Anon (2001)</a> estimated 16% of horticultural soils contained &#62;0.05% P, with lesser percentages associated with all other land uses. The median concentration of TP for 11 surface horizons of New Zealand reference soils (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref85">Vortman 1980</a>) was 0.049% P, with a range of 0.012&#8211;0.233% P, almost always with lower concentrations in sub-soils.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 9.1.</strong> Continuous relationships between concentrations of total soil P (pooled methods) vs median robust % coefficients of variations (CVs), derived from 1997&#8211;2007 ASPAC Proficiency Testing Programs.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Chemists quickly established that TP concentrations rarely provided a reliable guide to whether or not plants would respond to applications of P. Measurement of TP, however, is highly relevant to mass-balance studies and the like.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Much of the TP is immobilised in forms not readily available to plants, such as organically bound P and insoluble mineral P. Whether natural to the soil or supplied from external sources, rocks and associated minerals are the primary source of this nutrient. Accordingly, methods to quantify TP derive from those developed for the analysis of silicate rocks (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref47">Metson 1961</a>). These need to function from close to zero concentrations to (less commonly) upwards of 1% P. For example, the average total P concentrations in basaltic rock and granites worldwide are around 0.14 and 0.07% P, respectively (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref83">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">ASPAC has data on TP covering the period 1997&#8211;2007 (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref62">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref70">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). The relationship between TP concentrations on robust coefficients of determination (CVs) shown in <a href="#ch9fig1">Figure 9.1</a> was derived from 72 samples, which ranged in concentration from 0.006&#8211;0.312% P, with a median of 0.039% P.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Extractable P</em></h3>
<p class="para">The lack of success of TP as a diagnostic test stimulated an ongoing quest to quantify and understand what affects and controls the supply of soil P, including extractions to assess readily available fractions. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref26">Dyer (1894)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref71">Russell and Prescott (1916&#8211;1917)</a> provided early insights, while more recent assessments with a focus on soil test methodology have been published (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref75">Sibbesen 1983</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref60">O&#8217;Halloran 1993</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref40">Kuo 1996</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref51">Moody and Bolland 1999</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The amount of P contained in the soil solution and the rate of P diffusion to the plant root surface affects the supply of soil P to plants (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref49">Moody 1985</a>). Additional factors are soil parent material, weathering processes, soil moisture status, vegetation, and historical land management practices. Not surprisingly, no single extracting reagent for &#8216;available&#8217; or &#8216;extractable&#8217; soil P has been formulated that can mimic the uptake of P by plant roots across the growing season (e.g. <a id="page_149"></a><a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref79">Thomas and Peaslee 1973</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref51">Moody and Bolland 1999</a>). Nevertheless, efforts to improve the effectiveness of extractable soil P tests are ongoing. One of these, beyond the scope of this chapter, is diffusive gradients in thin films technology (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref91">Zhang 2003</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref46">Menzies <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Many different extractants for soil P (and sometimes concurrently for other nutrients) have resulted: see Table 7 of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref32">Hedley <em>et al.</em> (1995)</a>. Criteria related to adoption include a good and robust correlation or association between analytical values and other attributes, such as plant yield or fertiliser requirement. In addition, the method also needs to be safe and relatively cheap to apply. A link between extractant chemistry and nutrient uptake by plant roots is an attractive additional criterion for adoption, provided the earlier-mentioned criteria are also met. In practice, the defined method should be followed closely, as changes to the specified extractant, the soil/solution ratio, analytical finish, and temperature of extraction can affect the results obtained. For example, JD Colwell (unpublished data) did indicate that the Colwell-P test performed at 20&#176;C could be expected to yield slightly lower results than obtained for the same soils at 25&#176;C. Specifically, soils testing 5 and 25 mg P/kg at 20&#176;C increased to 5.3 and 25.8 mg P/kg at 25&#176;C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Across Australasia, several empirical extractants for soil P are used or are suitable for use by soil testing services. Those in wide use or justified from results of recent research include the bicarbonate extractions of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref58">Olsen <em>et al.</em> (1954)</a>, lactate-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref36a">Holford <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>), fluoride-extractable P (Bray 1; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref12">Bray and Kurtz 1945</a>), dilute CaCl<sub>2</sub>- extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref52">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref23">Dear <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>), and acid-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref39">Kerr and von Stieglitz 1938</a>). Manual, and in most cases, automated colorimetric procedures for measuring the PO<sub>4</sub>-P present in the relevant soil extracts are included in this chapter. Details of the Mehlich 3-extractable P test (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref45">Mehlich 1984</a>), a popular, universal soil test (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref08">Benton Jones 1990</a>) used widely in North America, are included as Method 18F.</p>
<p class="indent-para">ASPAC, via its Australasian soil inter-laboratory proficiency programs (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref62">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref70">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>), has compiled method performance data on three extractable P tests (Colwell, Olsen, Bray 1) for over a decade. <a href="#ch9fig2">Figure 9.2</a> shows the continuous relationships between median robust co-efficients of variations (robust % CVs) (after the removal of errant data) and corresponding extractable P concentrations for 72 samples for the period 1997&#8211;2007. Although considerable measurement uncertainty exists, the Colwell-P and Olsen-P tests were consistently better performed than was the Bray 1-P test.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>P fixation/sorption</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soils have vastly different P sorption properties, sufficient to affect the rates of fertiliser needed to overcome P deficiency (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref33">Helyar and Spencer 1977</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref36">Holford and Mattingly 1979</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref41">Kuo <em>et al.</em> 1988</a>). Further, soils may be grouped on the basis of their ability to remove and/or retain P from aqueous solution. The Japanese have long used a P-sorption coefficient to identify volcanic ash soils (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref02">Anon 1973</a>), while the anion storage capacity test (previously termed phosphate retention test) developed in New Zealand (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref73">Saunders 1965</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref74">1968</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref09">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) is included in soil taxonomic criteria for confirmation of the dominance of amorphous material (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref80">Thomas <em>et al.</em> 1979</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref64">Piper (1944)</a> saw worth in measuring the anion exchange capacity of soils, including &#8216;exchangeable P&#8217;. This was obtained by treating soil with NaOH solution, thus replacing adsorbed P by the hydroxyl ion. Nowadays, anion exchange capacity is viewed as a misleading term from a P-sorption perspective. It is more informative to compare soils at equal residual concentrations of P in solution (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref06">Beckwith 1965</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">P sorption isotherms relate mathematically the amount of P sorbed by soil to the concentration remaining in corresponding equilibrating solutions under a specified set of conditions. Soil/solution ratio, the vigour, the temperature, period of extraction and the chemistry of the supporting electrolyte are critical variables. While the EPC and the slope of the isotherm can be derived for each soil, typically four or more analyses must be performed. This provides data richness but is analytically costly. An alternative is to use an &#8216;index&#8217; or similar approach that significantly lessens the analytical demand to one or two measurements (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref23">Dear <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_150"></a><a id="ch9fig2"></a><img src="../images/f0150-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 9.2.</strong> Continuous relationships between extractable P concentrations vs median robust % CVs for 72 samples and three methods, derived from 1997&#8211;2007 ASPAC Proficiency Testing Programs.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref05">Bache and Williams (1971)</a> developed a P sorption index based on one addition of 150 mg P/100 g soil with a 17 h period of equilibration. Their &#8216;index&#8217; related to the slopes of P sorption isotherms used to establish their test. Indeed, the slope is an isotherm&#8217;s most distinctive single-value feature. The slope of Q/I plots have also been used to estimate soil P buffering capacity. As soil P buffer capacity increases, the proportion of labile P taken up by plants, whether native or from fertiliser, tends to decrease. Labile soil P typically accounts for &#60;5% of TP, and is less tightly bound than stable P. Some labile P, as well as solution P, is measured with extractable soil P tests.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Other researchers support the &#8216;index&#8217; approach but with different equilibration conditions. For example, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref35">Holford and Cullis (1985)</a> demonstrated a concentration of 248 mg P/kg was well correlated with fertiliser effectiveness in wheat-growing soils of New South Wales. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> (1988)</a> suggested a concentration range for single-point sorption indices of 60&#8211;248 mg P/kg. The New Zealand anion storage capacity test uses a 1000 mg P/L equilibration solution with a contact time of 16 h at a 1:5 soil/solution ratio.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A PBI test has since been developed for use in Australia (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref16">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>) as a surrogate for characterising the P buffer capacity (P sorptivity or P &#8216;fixing&#8217; ability) of soils. This index originally included in its calculation Colwell-P (PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub>) or Olsen-P (PBI<sub>&#43;OlsenP</sub>), but recent research on a small data set (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref17">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>) suggests that an unadjusted PBI is better suited to commercial soil P testing, since it more accurately reflects changes in soil P sorption capacity following P fertilisation.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_151"></a><em>Environmental P tests</em></h3>
<p class="para">Whether or not P moves off-site to waterways in quantities of environmental concern is influenced by:</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras1">&#8226;&#160;&#160;soil type and topography, including propensity to erode and whether the P remains water soluble or rapidly fixes in a form that resists relocation;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;distance from the paddock to a sensitive waterway or groundwater;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;direct transport via crop residues, farm animals, fire, and atmospheric cycling, often moderated by riparian vegetation and the like;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;type of nutrient carrier &#8211; e.g. commercial fertiliser (formulation, particle size, element, whether coated or otherwise), irrigation water, and bio-wastes;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;the presence/absence of soil and climatic conditions that prevent good plant growth, such as acid soil infertility, high salinity, a nutrient imbalance, adequate plant available water, etc.;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;the rate, timing and placement of the fertiliser relative to soil fertility status, crop rooting depth, stage of growth, freedom from disease, etc.;</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras">&#8226;&#160;&#160;the area of land to which nutrients are applied, and</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras2">&#8226;&#160;&#160;whether the biochemistry of the waterway/water body encourages further releases of fixed P or alternatively assimilates the P in a benign manner.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Phosphorus is one of the main nutrients responsible for the eutrophication of waterways, causing the aquatic ecosystem&#8217;s primary productivity to increase in harmful ways. Effects include oxygen depletion and severe declines in water quality, fish, and other animal populations. Loss of P from land to water can occur via soil erosion, dissolved in runoff and via leaching. Soil P levels above those required for maximum economic production contribute to the environmental risk, which is exacerbated if portion of the soil P can dissolve in runoff water or in leachates.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Applications for soil P testing have now expanded in response to a growing need for P-based nutrient management plans. Specifically, soil tests to predict the risk of P transport in runoff have emerged (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref42">Maguire and Sims 2002</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref10">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref89">Withers <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>) and will increase in importance. Soil P tests may also be able to assess the likelihood that the P present in soils that reach and become bottom sediments in waterways have different degrees of redox sensitivity, sufficient to affect the release of soluble P to the water column (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref10">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two index or ratio tests to assess the risk of P transport in runoff are included. One is the Mehlich 3-P Saturation Ratio (M3PSR) (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref42">Maguire and Sims 2002</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref10">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>). A second option is provided by the ratio of Colwell-P/PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub> (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref53">Moody <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>). Methods based on extraction with 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (methods 9F1/9F2) also warrant consideration.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Soil preparation</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soil samples for P, irrespective of test, are best kept at &#8804;4&#176;C during transport to the laboratory, where they are usually dried, ground and/or sieved and stored before analysis. These processes enable soils to be analysed for a wide range of tests in addition to P.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Drying may stimulate increased fragility of the organic P fraction of soils, thus leading to possible small changes in extractable soil P fractions (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref27">Etchevers 1986</a>). This possibility, however, is usually ignored for routine soil testing, where drying temperatures of &#8804;40&#8211;45&#176;C for &#8804;24 h are commonly recommended. Fine grinding of &#60;2 mm samples to &#8804;0.5 mm helps <a id="page_152"></a>lower sample heterogeneity and is often used in proficiency testing programs. For empirical tests, however, analysts should use the specified soil particle size.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>P Methods&#8217; summary</em></h3>
<p class="para"><a href="#ch9tab2">Table 9.2</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter for measuring TP and empirical soil P tests. More details on each are covered in method preambles. Examples of internal laboratory measurement uncertainty are summarised in <a href="backmatter02.html#backmatter02">Appendix 2</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec01"></a>9A Total P</h3>
<p class="para">Three methods for TP, one based on X-ray fluorescence (XRF), the second based on fusion with sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), and a third obtained following Kjeldahl digestion, are described. In addition, <a href="chapter17.html#chapter17">Chapter 17</a> includes methods that involve digestion with strong acids that, like Kjeldahl P, provide &#8216;pseudo-totals&#8217; lower than the true value. Proficiency testing services should take account of likely differences between methods before &#8216;pooling&#8217; results during the assessment of measurement performance for TP.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Digestion procedures involving use of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and perchloric acid (HClO<sub>4</sub>) have been avoided due to safety concerns in some laboratories. One such method uses boiling hydrochloric acid (HCl) following a pre-ignition treatment known to reduce the solubility of soil-titanium compounds to about 10&#8211;20% of those of &#8216;paired&#8217; non-ignited soils. That method (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref07">Beckwith and Little 1963</a>) uses 70% HClO<sub>4</sub> to expel excess HCl.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec02"></a>9A1 Total P &#8211; X-ray fluorescence</h3>
<p class="para">This method is based on techniques described by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref56a">Norrish and Hutton (1964)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref56">Norrish and Chappell (1967)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref14">Brown and Kanaris-Sotiriov (1969)</a>. Dry-powder pellets of finely divided (&#60;0.05 mm) soil are used. Quantitative analysis by XRF should have measurement accuracy as good as 10% (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref84">Vempati <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>), which is superior to the ASPAC &#8216;pooled&#8217; data (<a href="#ch9fig1">Figure 9.1</a>) that have a median robust CV of 13%. Note that Method 17A1 provides an alternative multi-elemental XRF option that uses modern instrumentation. Both total P and total S could be included in the multi-element suite.</p>

Add 2 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to suppress biological activity.

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Fusion with Sodium Carbonate</em></p>
<p class="para">Weigh 0.250 g of finely ground (&#60;0.1 mm) air-dry soil into a 60 mL platinum crucible or palau dish. Add approx. two-thirds of a weighed 3.0 g amount of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and stir thoroughly with a platinum wire or glass rod. Cover the mix with the residual 1 g Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Place the covered dish at a slight angle on a silica triangle over a Bunsen/Meeker gas burner. Heat gently for about 5 min until the sample is molten, carefully lifting cover to allow air to enter. It is important to ensure the burner&#8217;s flame does not completely envelop the dish in order to avoid reducing conditions during fusion. The hot crucible should be held with platinum-tipped tongs.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Increase heat gradually until full heat of the flame is being used. The bottom of the crucible/dish should be bright cherry-red. Maintain this heat for 25&#8211;30 min and periodically remove the lid to allow admission of air, and swirl the dish and contents. Any fusion mixture adhering to the underside of the lid should be fused by heating the lid in the flame.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Hold the crucible/dish with platinum-tipped tongs and swirl until melt has solidified around the sides. Cool and transfer contents of the crucible/dish plus lid to a 250 mL beaker. Wash any residue off the underside of the lid with about 2 mL of 4.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> from a graduated pipette, then set lid aside. Cover beaker with watch-glass and carefully add a further 13 mL of 4.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> into dish through the gap between beaker spout and a watch-glass cover. When effervescence has completely subsided, tip contents of the crucible/dish into the beaker and remove the crucible/dish after washing it thoroughly with hot deionised water.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Digest for 1 h on a boiling water bath and filter (Whatman No. 42) into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Wash beaker and filter paper with hot deionised water, cool, and make to volume. At this point, the P in solution can be measured as orthophosphate, as any polyphosphates that may form during fusion will be hydrolysed.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Analysis</em></h3>
<p class="para">Pipette a 10 mL aliquot of the prepared solution containing not more than 25 &#956;g P, into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Dilute with deionised water to about 80 mL and then adjust the solution to about pH 5 as follows: add 1 drop of <em>p</em>-nitrophenol indicator and then add 1 &#43; 1 NH<sub>4</sub>OH drop by drop until the solution just turns yellow (for a 10 mL aliquot this should take from 1.0 to 2.0 mL). Add 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> drop by drop until the solution just loses its yellow colour. Ignore any precipitates of Fe and Al hydroxides that may form, as these redissolve when acid molybdate is added during colour development. Add 8 mL Mixed Colour Reagent, make to volume with deionised water and mix well. The colour remains stable for about 24 h and maximum intensity is reached in &#8776;10 min. After 30 min, measure the absorbance at 882 nm.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The P Working Standard solutions are treated with p-nitrophenol, etc., in the same manner as the diluted soil assays. Prepare a calibration curve of absorbance against concentration of the standards and interpolate (or calculate) the P concentration for the assays in &#956;g P in 100 mL.</p>

<p class="para">Method 7A2a for total Kjeldahl N uses a semi-micro Kjeldahl front-end, wherein the Kjeldahl digest described in Method 7A1 is diluted to a known volume prior to subsequent instrumental analysis. This related method is based on use of 50 mL digestion tubes heated on a drilled aluminium (Al) block on a hot-plate. The Kjeldahl digestion uses 18 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) to raise the boiling point, and copper as a catalyst. All or almost all P in the sample is converted to orthophosphate.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Subsequently, orthophosphate in the digest is determined by a colorimetric method utilising flow injection analysis (FIA) or a continuous segmented flow alternative. The FIA technology is briefly described in Method 7A2b, while the colorimetric reaction involves use of ammonium molybdate and potassium antimony tartrate under acidic conditions. The molybdenum-blue complex, formed following reduction with ascorbic acid, absorbs at 882 nm. Soluble silicate can cause positive analytical interference, but a silicate concentration &#62;100 mg/L would be needed to produce an error of 0.015 mg P/L. Kjeldahl N and K in soil can also be determined using this method; see Note 1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">While FIA is described, continuous segmented flow analysis is an appropriate alternative. Irrespective of the analytical technology, it is acknowledged that the analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method.</p>

<p class="para">This empirical method favours both readily available and the quantity component of soil P. It provides an estimate of P fertility via correlations with crop and pasture response to P on acid, neutral, and alkaline soils in several Australian regions (e.g. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref67">Rayment and Helyar 1980</a>). It has also been used to assess the &#8216;available&#8217; P status of many Australian soils (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref77">Stace <em>et al.</em> 1968</a>), and is one of two soil P tests required for the final calculation of PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ratings for bicarbonate-extractable P relevant to north-eastern Australia (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref15">Bruce and Rayment 1982</a>; <a href="#ch9tab4">Table 9.4</a>) provide guidance on levels typical of many natural surface soils. Soils with a significant past history of fertiliser applications could contain three or more times the upper value in <a href="#ch9tab4">Table 9.4</a>, while the vast majority of unfertilised Australian soils would rate as very low to low.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The bicarbonate extracting solution [0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5 (with NaOH)] is best when freshly prepared on the day of use. Moreover, there is no inclusion of activated C prior to soil extraction for 16 h at a soil/solution ratio of 1:100 (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>). The manual analytical finish of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> is based on <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>, following acidification of the bicarbonate extract with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. This acid is preferred to HCl for neutralisation of the bicarbonate extract, since the latter lowers the sensitivity of spectrophotometric methods involving the molybdophosphoric blue complex (e.g. <a href="chapter07.html#ch7tab1">Table 7-1</a> of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref37">Jackson 1962</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The alternative, automated analytical finish of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref19">Colwell (1965)</a> is no longer recommended, as it includes chemical modifications sufficient to sometimes affect the outcome, one being the use of HCl for neutralisation and the other involving strong heating. Papers by <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref87">Watanabe and Olsen (1965)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref72">Salt (1968)</a>, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref24">Dick and Tabatabai (1977)</a> and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref78">Tarapchak (1983)</a> present evidence that hydrolysis of organic P is enhanced by long time periods for colour development, and by heating. Excessive acidification has also been shown (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref38">John 1970</a>) to elevate apparent P concentrations. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref44">McLeod (1982)</a> provides further information on NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-soluble P.</p>

<p class="para">The method is a modification (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>) of the original bicarbonate procedure of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref58">Olsen <em>et al.</em> (1954)</a>. It employs an extracting solution of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> adjusted to pH 8.5 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a soil/solution ratio of 1:100, and an extraction time of 16 h at 25&#176;C. The manual colorimetric finish is based on the method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>. There is no prior adjustment of soil pH, or any attempt to remove possible interferences such as arsenate and silicates. Any precipitation during the final determination of soluble P, possibly associated with organic compounds, is ignored. Slight acidification of soil extracts with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> just before final analysis helps to minimise positive interferences from soluble silicates.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Distilled water is specified because it is typically free of organic impurities that can interfere with this reagent. Alternatively, deionised water can be used if it contains no significant organic impurities (including resin functional groups) that can sometimes interact with the reagent, with consequential adverse analytical effects.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Residual acidity during colour development has been designed to avoid self-reduction by molybdate ions, a situation that can occur if acidity is too low (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref11">Boltz and Mellon 1947</a>). Positive interference from Si may also occur if acidity is too low. To check, introduce two tubes of Si Solution in place of soil extracts. If a stable baseline is maintained, this is evidence that there is sufficient residual acidity present. If significant peaks are observed, the pump tube supplying H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to neutralise NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts may be delivering too little acid and/or the acid strength may need to be increased slightly.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter09sec09"></a>9C Olsen-extractable P (Olsen-P)</h3>
<p class="para">The method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref58">Olsen <em>et al.</em> (1954)</a> has wide international acceptance as an indicator of soil P fertility. Olsen&#8217;s method is based on extraction of air-dry soil with 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, adjusted to pH 8.5 with NaOH. Soil extraction is for 30 min at a soil/solution ratio of 1:20. There is no prior adjustment of soil pH, or any attempt to remove possible interferences such as arsenate and silicate.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soluble orthophosphate-P in the clarified soil extracts was originally measured using the procedure of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref25">Dickman and Bray (1940)</a>, with activated C (P-free) included during soil extraction to absorb soluble organic matter and organic P. Subsequently, it was demonstrated (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref87">Watanabe and Olsen 1965</a>) that activated C could be excluded from the extraction step when soluble P was measured manually by the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> procedure. This analytical finish is incorporated in the manual and automated methods described. Soil extracts by this method typically have more organic matter colouring than do corresponding extracts obtained using the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell (1963)</a> modification. This can be the cause of analytical interference, especially when soils high in OM are acidified as part of the colorimetric reaction.</p>

<p class="para">The automated colorimetric finish of this method was adapted in Victoria (G Rubenis) from <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref19">Colwell (1965)</a>.

<p class="para">The weakly acidic Bray 1-P test was developed by Bray and Kurtz (1945), particularly for use to assess the P status of acid to neutral soils. The extractant is a dilute solution (0.03 M) of ammonium fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>F) and 0.025 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). It was designed to operate at a 1:7 soil/solution ratio with an extraction time of 60 sec. The test integrates the quantity and intensity components of labile P and hence gives a critical value for plant response to P fertiliser that does not vary with changing soil buffer capacity. It sometimes extracts excess P from soils of high Al status and is inappropriate for use on soils containing &#62;2% of dolomite or limestone (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref29">Frank <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Bray No. 2 Extracting Solution contains the same concentration of NH<sub>4</sub>F but has a higher HCl concentration of 0.1 M. Accordingly, it favours sorbed plus acid-soluble forms of P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref43">McIntosh 1969</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Different groups have modified the specifications of the Bray 1-P test, perhaps sufficiently to affect soil test results (see <a href="#ch9tab5">Table 9.5</a> for examples).</p>
<p class="indent-para">This fluoride-based test is reported to be suited to predicting yield response to P by legume-based pastures on acid to neutral soils of New South Wales. Otherwise, it is little employed in Australia beyond that State, although it is used internationally, including the north central Region of the United States, where it is the most common soil P test.</p>

<p class="para">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent-para">While Bray 1-P is a relatively simple and quick soil P test for &#8216;sorbed P&#8217;, the very short extraction time (60 sec) makes it prone to &#8216;out-of-specification&#8217; operation, which may affect results. This is supported by findings from over 10 years of inter-laboratory proficiency testing in Australasia, where Bray 1-P has consistently been the worst-performed extractable P test in programs operated by ASPAC. The other two tests are Colwell-P and Olsen-P (e.g. <a href="#ch9fig2">Figure 9.2</a>, and <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref69">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>). Clearly, strict adherence to method specifications is imperative. Manual and automated colorimetric procedures are provided as Method 9E1 and 9E2.</p>
<p class="indent-para">As with other soil P tests that employ a molybdenum-blue analytical finish, interferences from silicate, arsenates and Fe<sup>3&#43;</sup> are possible, if at elevated concentrations. For example, a Si concentration of &#8776;4000 mg/L could cause a positive error of &#8776;1.0 mg PO<sub>4</sub>-P/L, while &#8805;50 mg Fe<sup>3&#43;</sup>/L could cause a negative error due to competition for the ascorbic acid reducing agent. Pre-treatment with sodium bisulfite can eliminate the Fe<sup>3&#43;</sup> (and arsenate) interference (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref29">Frank <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>) but such action is rarely necessary.</p>

<p class="indent-para">The main principles for selecting the &#8216;index&#8217; method to use are:</p>
<p class="hangindent-paras1">&#8226;&#160;&#160;effective across a wide range of soils;</p>

<p class="indent-para">Full analytical details for Method 9I1 (Phosphate Sorption Index) have been available for years (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref68">Rayment and Higginson 1992</a>); however, it has not been used widely. The Anion Storage Capacity test (Method 9H1) has greater support, particularly in New Zealand. It has an application in Soil Taxonomy and in New Zealand&#8217;s revised soil classification system.</p>
<p class="indent-para">A P index test (termed PBI) was developed, particularly for use in Australia (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref16">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). The expectation was that PBI would better reflect changes in P sorptivity or P &#8216;fixing&#8217; ability of fertilised soils. That test incorporates a measure of contemporary soil P fertility (either Colwell-P or Olsen-P), although more recent research suggests it may be preferable not to adjust the index for current soil P fertility (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref17">Burkitt <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>). Methods with (9I2 and 9I3) and without (9I4) adjustments for current soil P fertility are included, inclusive of alternative analytical &#8216;finishes&#8217;.</p>

<p class="para">A standardised P sorption measurement, which embraces adsorption as well as precipitation reactions, can reveal useful information at relatively low analytical cost. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref05">Bache and Williams (1971)</a> introduced the concept of a P index, based on one addition of 150 mg P/100 g soil in &#8776;0.02 M potassium chloride (KCl) in the ratio 1:20 g/mL.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In Australia, <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref35">Holford and Cullis (1985)</a> demonstrated that a one-addition concentration of 248 mg P/kg provided a useful &#8216;P index&#8217; for wheat-growing soils of NSW. <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref50">Moody <em>et al.</em> (1988)</a> subsequently preferred a one-addition concentration range between 60 and 248 mg P/kg. The single-addition for this method is equivalent to 150 mg P/kg soil as potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) contained in an Extracting Solution of 0.02 M KCl at a soil/solution ratio of 1:20 for 17 h. Residual H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in the equilibrating solution is determined by the method of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a>.

<p class="para">Weigh 7.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into a 100 mL bottle or centrifuge tube and add 70 mL of P Equilibrating Solution and 3 drops of chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) (other weight/volume combinations can be used provided a soil/solution ratio of 1:10 is preserved and the head space in the extracting vessel is about 25% of the total vessel volume). Stopper and shake for 17 h continuously end-over-end (e.g. 15 rpm, 20 cm radius) at 25&#176;C. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm [RCF = 2096 G] or filter (Whatman No.5) to obtain uncontaminated, particulate-free supernatant solutions for P analysis. Contact time between supernatant and soil should not exceed 1 h.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For the <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> analytical finish, dilute the cleared soil extracts 1&#43;9 with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and pipette 5 mL aliquots of the diluted extracts and working standards (0 to 10.0 mg P/L) in 50 mL volumetric flasks.

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation of PBI<sub>&#43;ColP</sub></em></h3>
<p class="para">Calculate the amount of freshly sorbed P (<em>Ps</em>) in the soil (mg P/kg) as the difference between the initial amount of P added (=1000 mg P/kg at the specified soil/solution ratio of 1:10) and the amount of P left in the equilibrating solution, expressed as mg P/kg air-dry soil. The latter is calculated by multiplying the final solution P concentration (<em>c</em> in mg P/L) by 10 (because the soil/solution ratio is 1:10).</p>
<p class="indent-para">As PBI is derived from the Freundlich equation for describing the relationship between total P sorbed and final solution P concentration (i.e. the P sorption curve), the total amount of P sorbed by the soil is calculated as the amount of previously sorbed P, plus the amount of freshly sorbed P. The previously sorbed P is estimated as the Colwell-extractable P (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref18">Colwell 1963</a>) status of the soil. The &#8216;total P sorbed&#8217; for use in calculating PBI is therefore the addition of the Colwell-P to the amount of freshly sorbed P as calculated earlier.</p>

<p class="para">Sorption curves can be established by the addition to soil of graded amounts of P in 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 0.02 M potassium chloride (KCl). The former solution is preferred here because: (i) it has been more commonly used in Australia and elsewhere (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref61">Ozanne and Shaw 1967</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref28">Fox 1978</a>; <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref66">Probert 1983</a>), and (ii) it is less aggressive than KCl. The supernatant P concentration (C) is measured following an equilibration period of 17 h. Calculation of the amount of P sorbed can then be made.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The P sorption curve for a given soil is constructed by plotting P sorbed against log<sub>10</sub>C for each addition of P. The plot is usually linear for most soils up to a supernatant P concentration of at least 0.1 mg P/L.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The equilibrium P concentration (EPC) is derived by extrapolation of the P sorption curve to the point when P sorbed = 0 (zero). The PBC, which is a reflection of the P sorbing or P fixing ability of the soil, corresponds to the slope of the regression line fitted to the P sorption curve. The higher the slope the higher the PBC.</p>

<p class="para">This method is equivalent to Method 9J1 except that an automated finish (<a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref86">Warrell and Moody 1984</a>) based on the colorimetric procedure of <a href="chapter09a.html#ch09ref55">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> is used to obtain the concentration of P remaining in solution following equilibration with soil. While AutoAnalyzer I/II technology is described, microbore or FIA are appropriate alternatives, ideally without any heating beyond 37&#176;C to speed colour development. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method. Whichever technology is used, the results obtained should be close to those obtained by Method 9J1.</p>

Very high levels of 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable P (methods 9F1/9F2) are also indicative of soils with above normal risk of P transport in runoff and leachate.
