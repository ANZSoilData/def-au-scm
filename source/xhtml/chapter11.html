<h2 class="h2a"><strong>Gypsum</strong></h2>
<p class="para">Solid phase water-soluble sulfates, especially gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) occur in many Australian soils in low rainfall areas and in wetter areas with high evaporation rates (<a href="#ch11ref05">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>). Gypsum is also added to soils as a source of soluble S and also as a soil amendment to lessen the adverse consequences of high soil sodicity (<a href="#ch11ref06">Shaw 1988</a>). It follows that the analysis of soils for gypsum could encounter indigenous gypsum of varying purity as well as applications that may exceed many tonnes/ha (e.g. <a href="#ch11ref04">Rayment and Ahern 1988</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two methods are provided. The first (Method 11A1) is a chemical procedure based on soil extraction with water, the selective precipitation of gypsum with acetone, re-dissolution in water and finally the measurement of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), as a component of the gypsum. The second (Method 11A2) is an indirect method guided by <a href="#ch11ref01">Beech <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> and based on MIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. If virtually all the total S is derived from gypsum, then an estimate of the maximum amount of gypsum in the sample can also be obtained by multiplying total S by the factor 5.37 (<a href="#ch11ref01">Beech <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>). <a href="#ch11tab1">Table 11.1</a> has summary details on the two gypsum methods. More details on each are covered in method preambles.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter11sec01"></a><strong>11A1 Total gypsum</strong></h3>
<p class="para">This method for gypsum in soil involves extraction with water in which gypsum is soluble to the extent of approximately 0.2 g/100 mL. This corresponds to 2% gypsum in soil following extraction at a 1:10 soil/water ratio. The maximum content of gypsum extracted at a 1:10 ratio should not exceed 1.5%, however, as the rate of dissolution of gypsum in water slows considerably near to its saturation point. Wider soil/water ratios must be employed when higher concentrations of gypsum are expected.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following extraction, gypsum is selectively precipitated with acetone, redissolved in water, and gypsum determined by measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in solution (<a href="#ch11ref02">Hesse 1971</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 10.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;0.5 mm) into a 250 mL wide-mouth plastic bottle when gypsum content is expected to be &#60;1.5%. Add 100 mL deionised water, stopper the bottle and mechanically shake for 17 h. Centrifuge or filter the suspension to remove all particulate material from the supernatant. If &#62;1.5% gypsum is expected, adjust soil weights and water volume as detailed in <a href="#ch11tab2">Table 11.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Test the clear supernatant for the presence of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> by transferring approximately 3 mL extract to a test tube. Add 10 drops 1.0 M HCl and &#8776;2 mL 1 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>. If turbidity develops, proceed with the analysis; absence of turbidity confirms gypsum is absent from the sample: see Note 1. When a positive SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> test is obtained, pipette 20 mL clear extract into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Add 20 mL acetone, mix thoroughly, let stand for 10 min and centrifuge until the supernatant is clear, then decant the liquid making sure no precipitate is lost.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Re-disperse the precipitate with 10 mL acetone by flowing the acetone from a pipette along the wall of the centrifuge tube. Centrifuge and decant, then dry the tube with precipitate in an oven set to &#8776;50&#176;C. Add 40 mL (or a known volume) of water by pipette, stopper and shake until the precipitate of gypsum has dissolved. Measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> by AAS or by ICPAES after diluting the solutions (e.g. 2x or 5x) so that concentrations fall within the range of the Ca Working Standards.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1. A qualitative indication of the presence of measurable SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> can be obtained using portion of the 1:5 soil/water extract from Method 4A1. Test by adding a dilute solution of barium chloride, after acidifying with HCl. A white precipitate is suggestive of the presence of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>; no precipitate suggests little or no measurable SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The HCl addition, and the corresponding possible release of CO<sub>2</sub>, avoids possible interference from carbonate ions, which could otherwise form a white precipitate of barium carbonate.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter11sec02"></a>11A2 Total gypsum by MIR reflectance spectroscopy</h3>
<p class="para">Infrared (IR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is an emerging technology that relies on statistical relationships between IR soil spectra and results obtained from &#8216;conventional&#8217; measurements, in this case for gypsum. This non-destructive analytical option derives from the knowledge (<a href="#ch11ref01">Beech <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>) that mid infrared reflectance (MIR) can be used to assess (for regulatory purposes) the purity of samples of commercial gypsum. Earlier, <a href="#ch11ref03">Janik <em>et al.</em> (1998</a>) demonstrated that MIR provided an alternative technology for soil analysis. For more details, see <a href="chapter06.html#chapter06">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method relies on knowledge that there are a number of spectral peaks in the MIR spectrum that are characteristic of and sensitive to gypsum. <a href="#ch11ref01">Beech <em>et al.</em> (2003</a>) noted these can be assigned to the fundamental gypsum (-O-S-O) vibrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> at 1260 cm<sup>-1</sup>, water of hydration (-OH) stretch of 3500 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and deformation vibrations (1690&#8211;1640 cm<sup>-1</sup>). Weaker peaks associated with overtones and combinations of fundamental vibrations (2234 and 5145 cm<sup>-1</sup>) may also contribute. The soil matrix adds considerable spectral complexity, which <a id="page_232"></a>could adversely affect the usefulness of relationships between actual and predicted soil gypsum concentrations.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Laboratories using this secondary method must initially confirm the existence of strong, robust and reliable relationships between outputs from their MIR analyser and conventional measurements of soil gypsum content. Alternatively, regional or national calibration datasets may become available, derived by &#8216;fingerprinting&#8217; modal examples from &#8216;legacy&#8217; and new soil collections (<a href="#ch11ref08">Viscarra Rossel <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>). If the conventional measurements used were originally expressed on an oven-dry basis, then the MIR results for gypsum will also allow the direct reporting of results on an oven-dry basis. Sequential scans typically take around 1&#8211;2 min/sample. This analytical option should only be used, however, when instrument calibrations, commonly but not exclusively based on partial least square regressions (<a href="#ch11ref07">Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>), are known to be repeatable and of reasonably high precision (e.g. R<sup>2</sup> values &#8805;0.85). Soil samples should be &#8776;40&#176;C air-dry and finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Stabilise and verify the set-up and operating performance of the MIR spectrometer, usually incorporating an auto-focussing diffuse reflectance accessory or capability. Also confirm the &#8216;standard calibration&#8217; for gypsum, likely based on Method 11A1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Load the instrument&#8217;s auto-sampler with &#8216;unknown soils&#8217;, previously dried to &#8776;40&#176;C and finely ground (&#8805;0.5 mm) to assist with sample uniformity. Typically, the instrument or its associated computer will integrate the spectral signals with the calibration equations to provide the result without further calculation, if the conventional method&#8217;s results were expressed on an oven-dry basis. If the calibration equations were based on conventional measurements expressed on an air-dry basis (&#8776;40&#176;C), then the MIR results will need to be adjusted for residual moisture using relevant air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratios, guided by Method 2A1.</p>
