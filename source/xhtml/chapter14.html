<h2 class="h2a">Saturation extracts</h2>
<p class="para">Saturation extracts of soils, obtained from saturated pastes, provide soil testing laboratories with a much used approximation of the soil solution, which is the aqueous liquid phase of the soil and its solutes, consisting of ions dissociated from the surfaces of soil particles and other soluble materials (<a href="#ch14ref01">Adams 1974</a>). Not surprisingly, the composition of soil solutions and SEs influence plant-soil interactions, including soil salinity and soil fertility. This chapter, adapted from <a href="#ch14ref19">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, focuses on obtaining SEs and the subsequent measurement of electrical conductivity (EC<sub>/SE</sub>), pH<sub>/SE</sub>, and soluble cations and anions in those extracts. The main applications are for research and monitoring, as most routine soil testing laboratories are not equipped to rapidly obtain soil solution extracts at usual field-water contents, even though improved procedures over those originally developed at the US Salinity Laboratory at Riverside, California (<a href="#ch14ref27">US Salinity Laboratory Staff 1954</a>) have been developed (e.g. <a href="#ch14ref11">Gillman 1976</a>; <a href="#ch14ref02">Aitken and Outhwaite 1987</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two methods for the preparation of saturated pastes have already been described [see Methods 2C1 (mixing) and 2D1 (wetting)]. In the mixing method, the amount of water added to soil is determined using the procedure of <a href="#ch14ref12">Loveday (1972)</a>, who used a capillary wetting apparatus to wet up soil at a tension of 1.0 cm, which approximates soil saturation conditions. The wetting method relies on visual examination of soil to the stage when the paste begins to glisten and slide freely from a spatula. Both the mixing method and wetting method can be criticised because they only rarely equate exactly to the true saturation water content in the field (<a href="#ch14ref23">Shaw 1999</a>). Nevertheless, the methods are reasonably reproducible. They also provide sufficient aqueous extract for subsequent analyses, without recourse to expensive extraction equipment (<a href="#ch14ref19">Rhoades 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Four alternatives for removing the SE from saturation pastes are given. These are separately coded, since the method of extraction can influence at least some of the results obtained (<a href="#ch14ref10">Dowling and Howitt 1987</a>). Procedures for the chemical analysis of SE are also provided. See Methods 2C1 and 2D1 for the moisture contents of soils associated with saturation pastes. In addition, <a href="#ch14tab1">Table 14.1</a> contains summary details of all methods in the chapter, including optional analytical finishes for cations and anions, while background information is provided in preambles to individual methods. For consistency and convenience, units of reporting of cations and anions are provided as the element in mg/L and as cmol<sub>c</sub>/L.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter14sec01"></a>14A1 Saturation extract &#8211; filter suction</h3>
<p class="para">This method requires very simple apparatus, but does result in contact between SE and the atmosphere. Solution yield can be disappointing particularly for cracking clays, and aeration can change carbonate chemistry (<a href="#ch14ref10">Dowling and Howitt 1987</a>). It should be used only when equipment for extraction by automatic extractor or centrifuge is unavailable or inconvenient.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Moisten a clean Whatman No. 50 filter paper with deionised water when in the Buchner funnel and apply suction to settle the paper. Next, transfer each of the saturated pastes to Buchner funnel/s and apply suction until 2&#8211;3 mL from each are extracted. Discard the initial extract, install a clean, dry borosilicate glass collecting tube, then apply suction until air just commences to pass through the filter. Remove the collecting tube plus extract from respective conical filter flasks and seal to prevent evaporation and excessive contact with the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Analyse the SE for electrical conductivity (EC<sub>/SE</sub>), pH<sub>/SE</sub>, monovalent bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3/SE</sub>) and divalent carbonate ions (CO<sub>3/SE</sub>) as quickly as possible following extraction.

How to undertake these determinations and subsequently to report results are described later in this chapter.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter14sec02"></a>14A2 Saturation extract &#8211; automatic extractor</h3>
<p class="para">In this method a proprietary automatic extractor (as made or similar to that made by Concept Engineering, Nebraska, USA) is used to obtain the soil SE. Filter paper clears the extract and suction pulls the extract into the collecting syringe.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Some saturated pastes are difficult to extract, mostly due to soil dispersion and puddling. Repeated extraction is possible to obtain sufficient extract for subsequent analyses. Some SE obtained by automatic extraction may require final clearing via high-speed centrifuging or 0.20 &#956;m Millipore filtration.</p>

The design may be adapted to suit the cup size of any medium-size laboratory centrifuge. It is an advantage to have a refrigerated centrifuge to allow extraction to take place at a constant temperature of &#8776;23&#8211;25&#176;C. In non-refrigerated centrifuges, temperatures in samples at the end of a large batch can reach 50&#176;C (R Shaw, unpublished data), with consequential effects on solubility and ionic speciation. The apparatus has several advantages over other designs for centrifugal extraction of soil saturation pastes. In particular, there is reduced contamination from the atmosphere (<a href="#ch14ref10">Dowling and Howitt 1987</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Procedure</em></h3>

<p class="para">While the EC of a 1:5 soil/water extract (EC<sub>1:5</sub> by Method 3A1) uses a convenient soil/extraction ratio for large-throughput soil testing laboratories, it suffers from being much more dilute than occurs naturally. This method for EC<sub>/SE</sub>, although tedious, better correlates with plant response to soil salinity (<a href="#ch14ref20">Salcon 1997</a>).

<p class="para">A diluted aliquot of SE is analysed by IC operating with chemical suppression of eluent EC. A small amount of sample is introduced into a stream of eluent and pumped through a column of ion exchange solid phase, where the anions are separated on the basis of their affinity for the active sites of the column packing material. Chloride and other anions such as sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>), fluoride (F<sup>-</sup>), phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#8211;</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>) can be quantified using an EC detector operating in either peak height or peak area mode. The application is only suited to the quantitative analysis of F<sup>-</sup> if extracts are known to be free (or made to be free) of interference from short-chain organic acids and carbonate. Also, monovalent perchlorate ions (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>) and Br<sup>&#8211;</sup> coelute under the specified conditions (Thorne 2004). For further background information on this analytical technology, refer to Method 5A3a, to Australian Standard AS 3741 (<a href="#ch14ref03">Anon 1990</a>), and to <a href="#ch14ref06">APHA-AWWA-WEF (2005c)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determination of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations, in conjunction with the other anions mentioned, involves injecting filtered aliquots (&#60;0.45 &#956;m with &#60;0.20 &#956;m membrane filter preferred) of SE into the IC, broadly configured for water analysis. In the Dionex system described, the sample is pumped through three different ion exchange columns and then into a conductivity detector (<a href="#ch14ref17">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> 1984</a>). The first column (pre-column) acts as a guard, protecting the second or separator column from fouling by particulates including OM. The separator column contains a styrene divinylbenzene-based anion exchange resin of low capacity, designed to separate anions based on their affinity for exchange sites on the resin. The third is a suppressor column packed with high-capacity cation exchanger, capable of converting the eluent and separated anions to their corresponding acids. Finally, the separated anions in their acid form are determined quantitatively by their respective retention times, following detection with an EC cell and comparison with known standards (<a href="#ch14ref17">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> 1984</a>; <a href="#ch14ref06">APHA-AWWA-WEF 2005c</a>).

<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;To obtain reproducible results using this method, careful attention must be paid to uniform temperature, time and rate of stirring, and time of standing of the SE before measurement. If air temperature in the laboratory is known to fluctuate, use a water bath to maintain temperature to within &#177; 0.1&#176;C. Note that prolonged mechanical stirring can heat up the aqueous mixture, as the electric motor in the stirrer can release heat.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;If desired, the measurement of absorbance can be automated. An example is turbidimetric flow-injection analysis, as described by <a href="#ch14ref15">Morais <em>et al.</em> (2001)</a>.</p>

The electrode measures F<sup>&#8211;</sup> activity rather than concentration, which is influenced by the total ionic strength of the sample. To compensate for variations in matrix ionic strength, measurements of samples and standards are carried out in the presence of a buffer solution. The buffer solution is necessary because the electrode also responds to OH<sup>&#8211;</sup> under alkaline conditions. In an acid medium, F<sup>&#8211;</sup> will complex with H<sup>+</sup> ions to form HF complexes. Raising the pH to 5&#8211;6 helps to break F<sup>&#8211;</sup> complexes with Al, Fe and Si. A chelating agent is included in the buffer to preferentially complex polyvalent ions and thereby release any bound F<sup>&#8211;</sup>. <a href="#ch14ref17">Nicholson and Duff (1981)</a> report that addition of tri-ammonium citrate to the buffer gives an improved performance of the ion-selective electrode.</p>

<p class="para1"><em>Ion-selective meter or digital pH meter.</em></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Set up the ion-selective meter (or equivalent), equipped with a F specific ion electrode and a sleeve-type reference calomel electrode, and associate millivolt values to F<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations across the range of Working Standards. When known to be operating within specifications, pipette 25 mL of each SE into separate 50 mL volumetric flasks and dilute each to volume with the TISAB Buffer. Maintain all solutions at the same temperature, preferably 25&#176;C. Transfer these diluted samples individually to clean 100 mL beakers, immerse the electrodes and begin gentle mechanical stirring. After 3 min, read the millivolt meter. Continue stirring until a stable reading is obtained. Record the final value. Rinse the electrodes, blot dry between readings and continue with each sample in turn. Also measure the undiluted F Working Standards.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare a calibration curve (or regression) relating millivolt values to F<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations of the Working Standards. Determine the F<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations of the test samples from the calibration curve. Frequently, recheck the values for the Working Standards and recalibrate if necessary. Dilute (with deionised water) a sub-sample of any (original) samples that exceed the range of F Working Standards, add TISAB as previously described, mix well, then reanalyse, adjusting for the dilution employed. Make due allowance for any reagent blank.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;A &#8216;sleeve-type&#8217; reference electrode is preferred to a fibre-tip reference electrode, since the latter are inclined to exhibit erratic behaviour when used with very dilute solutions.</p>

<p class="para">Fluoride and other anions including Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub>-S, NO<sub>3</sub>-N and PO<sub>4</sub>-P, are included in the analytical suite described in more detail in Methods 5A3a and 14E2a. As earlier mentioned (see <a href="#ch14ref06">APHA-AWWA-WEF 2005c</a>), this IC technology is not recommended for F<sup>&#8211;</sup> at very low concentrations and in unknown matrices, the latter for reasons including possible interference from simple organic acids (formic, carbonic, etc) that elute close to F<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Bromates and chlorates may also interfere. There are &#8216;work-arounds&#8217; using special columns, dilute eluent or gradient elution with NaOH. IC analyses can be completed sequentially within 30 min or less using a few mL of extract. Alternative IC technology, based on a single-column with electronic suppression of eluent conductivity, is provided as Method 14G2b.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_287"></a><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Double check that with the column/eluent combination selected, F ion &#8216;peaks&#8217; do not exhibit &#8216;water dip&#8217;; i.e. F<sup>&#8211;</sup> peaks should be clearly visible above the reagent baseline, even at low concentrations. When confirmed, analyse an aliquot of the SE by this IC technology as outlined in Method 14E2a. No particles in the SE should exceed 0.20 &#956;m.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report F<sup>&#8211;</sup><sub>/SE</sub> (mg/L) with relevant method codes, or divide by 18.998 to convert to cmol<sub>c</sub>F/L.</p>

<p class="para">In common with Method 14G2a, F<sup>&#8211;</sup> and other anions, including Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub>-S, NO<sub>3</sub>-N and PO<sub>4</sub>-P, are included in this analytical suite, described in more detail in Methods 5A3b and 14E2b. The method has high sensitivity (see <a href="#ch14ref07">APHA-AWWA-WEF 2005d</a>) so is suitable for F<sup>&#8211;</sup> determinations, provided high-quality reagents are used. Minimum detectable concentrations of anions are &#8776;0.02&#8211;0.12 mg/L with an injection volume of 100 &#956;L, although detection levels can be reduced by increasing the injection volume.
