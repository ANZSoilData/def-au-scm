<p class="para"><a href="chapter18.html#chapter18">Chapter 18</a> of <a href="#ch18ref64">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a> provided two tests for extractable K<sup>+</sup>. These simple soil fertility tests are retained with the same code numbers. In addition, this chapter provides a selection of other soil tests, brief details of which are summarised in <a href="#ch18tab1">Table 18.1</a>. All of the tests commence with air-dry soil of &#60;2 mm. Each method contains background and application details.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter18sec01"></a>18A1 Bicarbonate-extractable K<sup>+</sup></h3>
<p class="para">The bicarbonate-extractable P test of <a href="#ch18ref25">Colwell (1963)</a>, based on 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) at pH 8.5, was in commercial use by the mid-1960s (<a href="#ch18ref32">Fogliati 1967</a>) as an aid to the responsible marketing of fertilisers in New South Wales. The opportunity to obtain an estimate of extractable K<sup>+</sup> in the same soil extract was quickly recognised. For example, <a href="#ch18ref26">Colwell and Esdaile (1968)</a> reported that for a wide range of soils, the K<sup>+</sup> extracted was highly correlated (r = 0.96) with exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> based on an ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) extraction at pH 7.0. Nowadays, this test, sometimes referred to as Colwell&#8211;K, is the &#8216;standard&#8217; diagnostic K test used in Western Australia (<a href="#ch18ref15">Bolland <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a>.</p>

<p class="indent-para1">Use of Method 18A1 is justified when comprehensive analysis to assess the ion exchange properties of soils is unavailable or unwarranted and when the test results are known to relate to crop response to applications of potash fertiliser. Examples of soil K fertility ratings are provided in <a href="#ch18tab2">Table 18.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Method 18A1 involves the measurement of K<sup>+</sup> in clarified extracts of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> at pH 8.5, following 16 h extraction, with subsequent analysis by flame photometry, AAS or ICPAES. Alternatively, K<sup>+</sup> may be determined by flame FES incorporated into a continuous segmented flow system. Analytically, the wide soil/solution ratio of 1:100 can be a disadvantage when measuring K<sup>+</sup> concentrations in extracts from soils low in soluble plus exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Undiluted 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> carries a high &#8216;salt&#8217; burden, often sufficient to extinguish an ICPAES plasma and to cause a build-up of &#8216;salt&#8217; deposits on the ICPAES torch and on burners during FES and AAS analysis, particularly when large batch-sizes of samples are involved. These effects can be minimised by at least 1+1 dilution with dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> of the clarified extracts and working standards prior to instrumental analysis, so the final diluted extract/working standards are approximately pH neutral. This procedure should be undertaken in a manner that permits the dissipation of CO<sub>2</sub> released as a consequence of acidic dilution.</p>

<p class="para">This method for &#8216;Nitric K&#8217; has been used in the sugar industry of Queensland for several decades (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref22">Chapman (1971)</a>). It is based on the extraction of soil K<sup>+</sup> by boiling with 1.0 M nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) for 30 min at an initial soil/solution ratio of 1:40 (<a href="#ch18ref35">Haysom 1971</a>).

<p class="indent-para">Diagnostically, the test estimates easily mineralisable K<sup>+</sup> available for crop growth.

Nil or little crop response by Queensland sugar cane to applied K fertiliser is expected when the root zone exceeds 0.6 cmol<sub>c</sub>K/kg by this test (<a href="#ch18ref05">Anon 1998</a>).

<p class="para">Weigh 2.5 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into 250 mL conical flask, graduated at 200 mL.

Add 100 mL of 1.0 M HNO<sub>3</sub> Extracting Solution to each conical flask, add two clean glass beads to each flask, and place these on the pre-heated hot plate without delay. Insert a small, clean glass funnel in the neck of each flask, then allow these flasks to reflux gently for 30 min. (Temperature of the extract solution should be maintained as close as possible to 100&#176;C during this period.)</p>
<p class="indent-para">After 30 min of gentle reflux, remove the flasks from the hotplate, then, with minimum delay, rinse and remove the funnels. Encourage rapid cooling to &#8776;23&#8211;25&#176;C by running tap (or cooling) water for 1&#8211;2 min or by partly submerging the conical flasks in a cold water bath for a similar time. (Ensure no coolant water contaminantes the contents of the flasks, which should all receive the same attention.)</p>
<p class="indent-para">Dilute the contents of each of the now cooled conical flasks accurately to 200 mL with deionised water and mix well. Next decant a portion of each extract into a suitable centrifuge tube, then centrifuge to clarify the soil extracts prior to instrumental analysis.

<p class="para">The occurrence of Itai-Itai disease in Japan, the long half-life of Cd in humans, and evidence that Cd causes kidney damage and other medical conditions in humans are reasons why contamination of soils and the wider environment by Cd has attracted international attention. An additional reason for concern arises because concentrations of Cd in food associated with undesirable accumulations in human tissues, particularly the kidneys, rarely affects the growth and appearance of food plants and animals. Standards that place limits on permitted concentrations (maximum levels) of Cd in the edible portions of various foods have helped in efforts to manage for Cd minimisation (<a href="#ch18ref59">Rayment 1991</a>; <a href="#ch18ref01">Abbott 2007</a>; <a href="#ch18ref79">Warne <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadmium is a rare Group IIB heavy metal (67th element in order of abundance). In common with Hg and Zn, Cd readily loses two electrons to form dipositive ions (<a href="#ch18ref08">Aylett 1971</a>), its predominant oxidation state in nature (<a href="#ch18ref82">WHO 1985</a>). Its inorganic chemistry (not its biochemistry) follows closely that of Zn (<a href="#ch18ref31">Fergusson 1990</a>), except that unlike Zn, Cd is insoluble in alkalis (<a href="#ch18ref08">Aylett 1971</a>; <a href="#ch18ref09">1979</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Within soils, Cd is extensively associated with colloidal and particulate matter, with speciation in oxic-soil solutions confined predominantly to (in decreasing order) free Cd<sup>2+</sup>, CdSO<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup> and CdCl<sup>1+</sup>. In oxic, alkaline soils the predominant water-soluble species are Cd<sup>2+</sup>, CdCl<sup>1+</sup>, CdSO<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup> and CdHCO<sub>3</sub>1+.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The proportion of organically-bound Cd in soil solution, even following sewage sludge addition, is relatively small (<a href="#ch18ref02">Alloway 1990</a>). Moreover, the amounts of electrically neutral CdSO<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup> and CdCl<sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup> species increase beyond pH 6.5. Adsorption processes rather than precipitation reactions control the distribution of Cd between soil-bound and soluble forms at the concentrations normally encountered in soils, including polluted soils (<a href="#ch18ref02">Alloway 1990</a>). The distribution diagram for Cd/oxy/hydroxide species indicates that most free Cd<sup>2+</sup> disappears from aqueous solutions by pH 10.</p>
<p class="indent-para">It is known that the uptake of Cd by vegetables such as Swiss chard and potatoes (<a href="#ch18ref12">Bingham <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>; <a href="#ch18ref44">McLaughlin <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>, <a href="#ch18ref43">1997</a>) is enhanced by the presence of elevated concentrations of soil and water Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Also, a wide array of soil tests for Cd have emerged, often to provide guidance on the phyto-availability of soil Cd (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref24">Clayton and Tiller 1979</a>; <a href="#ch18ref76">Sposito <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>; <a href="#ch18ref16">Brams and Anthony 1988</a>). The task is challenging, because in addition to Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, soil properties such as pH, plus the extent and location of Cd additions from impurities in phosphatic fertilisers, sewage sludge, industrial wastes, etc all influence plant Cd uptake.</p>
<p class="indent-para">European specialists report a preference for CaCl<sub>2</sub> as the extractant for routine use in assessing plant-available Cd (and Zn) in soil (<a href="#ch18ref68">Salt and Kloke 1986</a>), although soil/solution ratios, extracting times, and concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> vary, the latter commonly from 0.01 M to 0.1 M. Theoretical, practical and analytical reasons account for the various concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> selected (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref69">Sauerbeck and Styperek 1985</a>, <a href="#ch18ref53">Novozamsky <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>). Others to report the successful use of dilute solutions of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, as indicators of Cd phyto-bioavailability across soil types, include <a href="#ch18ref50">Morgan and Alloway (1984)</a>, <a href="#ch18ref40">K&#246;nig (1986)</a> and <a href="#ch18ref03">Alloway <em>et al.</em> (1990)</a> for vegetables, and <a href="#ch18ref81">Whitten and Richie (1991)</a> for subterranean clover tops.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This method is based on that of <a href="#ch18ref69">Sauerbeck and Styperek (1985)</a> and <a href="#ch18ref74">Smilde et al (1992)</a>. It involves extraction of air-dry soil with 0.1 M CaC1<sub>2</sub> for 2 h at a soil/solution ratio of 1:2.5, with subsequent instrumental analysis for Cd by ICP-MS (preferred) or graphite furnace, or by ICPAES when solution concentrations are expected to exceed &#8776;0.05 mg Cd/L. Analytical attributes of the method include: (i) it extracts similar forms but higher amounts of Cd than more-dilute solutions of CaCl<sub>2</sub> under otherwise similar conditions, simplifying the subsequent analytical measurement of Cd; (ii) higher amounts of Cd in soil extracts minimise the <a id="page_392"></a>consequences of accidental contamination in the laboratory, and (iii) it has been shown to be a useful predictor of Cd concentrations in edible plant tissues in Europe (<a href="#ch18ref69">Sauerbeck and Styperek 1985</a>) and in commercially grown vegetables from Queensland (<a href="#ch18ref60">Rayment 1994</a>). Expect concentrations (mg Cd/kg air-dry) in &#8216;normal&#8217; horticultural soils to average around 0.032 &#177; 0.028 at 0&#8211;100 mm and 0.019 &#177; 0.016 at 200&#8211;300 mm (n &#8776;190; <a href="#ch18ref60">Rayment 1994</a>), while values of at least 2.5 mg Cd/kg have been obtained from contaminated soils (<a href="#ch18ref69">Sauerbeck and Styperek 1985</a>). Total and extractable levels of Cd commonly decline with increasing soil depth (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref83">Williams and David 1973</a>; <a href="#ch18ref57">Pierce <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>; <a href="#ch18ref66">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>).</p>

<p class="hangindent-paraj">1.&#160;&#160;(a)&#160;&#160;As recommended by <a href="#ch18ref52">Murphy (1976)</a>, stoppers and tubing made of rubber and PVC should be avoided, as these are &#8216;dirty&#8217; with respect to trace metal impurities.</p>
<p class="hangindent-paraj1">(b)&#160;&#160;To clean glassware and plastic-ware, initially soak for about 2 days in 2% Decon, a non-ionic detergent. Afterwards, rinse with DDW, then soak in a 10% v/v HNO<sub>3</sub>/DDW solution for up to 7 days, followed by rinsing. Soaking-baths must be replenished periodically with relevant solutions. When the apparatus is dry and/or when not required for immediate use, store in clean, sealed, polyethylene bags, or invert on a polyethylene sheet in a dust-free cupboard. If laboratory-ware is known to contain insignificant Cd contamination due to prior use, the prescribed cleaning procedures may be expedited but not overlooked. Periodically monitor the effectiveness of these measures via the use of blanks and quality-control reference samples.</p>
<p class="hangindent-paraj1">(c)&#160;&#160;Periodically tests the purity of the DDW using electrical conductivity (this should be &#8804;0.5 mS/m) and the dithizone test of <a href="#ch18ref77">Stout and Arnon (1939)</a>. Key points of the dithizone test are:</p>
<p class="hangindent-paraj2">&#8226;&#160;&#160;Prepare dithizone reagent by dissolving 100 mg high-grade diphenylthiocarbazone in 10 mL of redistilled chloroform. Store this stock solution in metal free glassware and a sub-volume in a clean dropping bottle. [Since chloroform reacts slowly with oxygen/oxidizing agents to form phosgene, chlorine, and HCl, particularly when exposed to light and air (<a href="#ch18ref67">Riddick and Toops 1955</a>), it must be stabilised if lengthy storage is envisaged. This can be achieved by adding 0.5&#8211;1.0% of redistilled ethanol.]</p>
<p class="hangindent-paraj2">&#8226;&#160;&#160;Prepare a separating funnel by dispensing into it (in a fume cupboard) in about 1.0 mL DDW, 5 mL of redistilled chloroform, 5 drops of 6 M NH<sub>4</sub>OH and 3 drops of dithizone reagent, followed by vigorously shaking by inverting at regular intervals for 1 min or more. Next allow the chloroform layer to settle out (any build up of vapour must be released periodically through the stop-cock during shaking). (Prepare the 6 M NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution by diluting high purity NH<sub>4</sub>OH reagent with DDW.)</p>
<p class="hangindent-paraj2">&#8226;&#160;&#160;Drain the chloroform layer to waste and retain the dithizone contained in the ammoniacal water in the separating funnel.</p>
<p class="hangindent-paraj2">&#8226;&#160;&#160;Add 200 mL of the water to be tested and 5 mL of chloroform into the separating funnel containing the purified dithizone, shake vigorously for 1 min or more, then allow the chloroform layer to settle out. Any red or purple colour indicates the presence of one or more of the following metals: Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Co, Hg, Cd, Tl, Bi. For precise studies, confirm the presence or absence of Cd (and any other metals of interest) by scanning the concentrated aqueous dithizone extract on an ICP at recommended wave lengths for these metals. If there is no response when the ICP is operated at maximum sensitivity, the relevant metal can be assumed to be absent for the purposes of this soil test. A larger volume of water may be tested if more accuracy is thought necessary.</p>
<p class="hangindent-paraj1">(d)&#160;&#160;Occasionally test for the presence of heavy metal contamination on the surface of items such as plastic tubing, gloves, etc with a few drops of the dithizone reagent. The formation of a red or purple colour indicates undesirable heavy metal contamination. <a id="page_395"></a>If the dithizone&#8217;s colour is too intense, a sub-sample can be diluted before use with redistilled chloroform.

<p class="indent-para">This method is similar to that of Method 18D1 but is sufficiently different to prevent the direct interchange of results. Specifically, it uses more dilute calcium chloride (0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> <em>cf.</em> 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>), a longer extraction time (4 h <em>cf.</em> 2 h) and a wider soil/solution ratio (1:5 <em>cf.</em> 1:2.5).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter18sec06"></a>18F Mehlich 3 multi-element tests</h3>
<p class="para">This multi-element test (<a href="#ch18ref46">Mehlich 1984</a>) covers extractable P, the basic exchangeable cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>), extractable S, selected trace elements (Cu, Mn, Zn, B), extractable Fe and extractable Al. Environmental soil P tests (<a href="#ch18ref13">Bloesch and Rayment 2006</a>) that can be derived from components obtained from Mehlich 3, specifically Mehlich 3&#8211;P saturation ratios, are documented in <a href="chapter09.html#chapter09">Chapter 9</a> as Method 9K1a [Mehlich 3&#8211;P Saturation Ratio (M3PSR<sub>colourP</sub>)] and as Method 9K1b [Mehlich 3&#8211;P Saturation Ratio (M3PSR<sub>ICPAES</sub>)].</p>
<p class="indent-para">The main function of the extractant&#8217;s components are (<a href="#ch18ref07">Anon 2007</a>): CH<sub>3</sub>COOH &#8211; buffers the extracting solution to pH 2.5 when all reagents are added and mixed, thus preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from being precipitated as calcium fluoride; NH<sub><em>4</em></sub>NO<sub><em>3</em></sub> &#8211; facilitates extraction of the exchangeable cations Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, since it reacts with the CH<sub>3</sub>COOH to form ammonium acetate; HNO<sub><em>3</em></sub> &#8211; extracts a portion of calcium phosphates, while its H<sup>+</sup> component aids the extraction of basic and micronutrient cations; NH<sub><em>4</em></sub>F &#8211; the F<sup>&#8211;</sup> component helps to extract Fe and Al phosphates, while NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> complements NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> in extracting basic cations; and EDTA &#8211; chelates micronutrients (particularly Cu) and prevents precipitation of calcium fluoride.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Mehlich 3 extractant has applicability for diagnostic purposes across a wide assortment of soils ranging in reaction from acidic to basic (<a href="#ch18ref37">Jones Jr. 1990</a>). It is used widely in North America and increasingly in other countries, including the Czech Republic (<a href="#ch18ref85">Zb&#237;ral and N<img src="../images/ebreve.jpg" alt="Image"></img>mec 2000</a>) and Australia (<a href="#ch18ref15">Bolland <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#ch18ref62">Rayment 2004</a>). <a href="#ch18ref65">Rayment <em>et al.</em> (2009)</a> have summarised the analytical performance of Australasian soil testing laboratories relative to North American laboratories for a suite of Mehlich 3 soil tests on four soils from North America.</p>
<p class="indent-para">In practice, the Mehlich 3 test utilises a 1:10 v/v soil-solution ratio or a 1:10 w/v ratio, inclusive of vigorous shaking for 5 min at 200 &#215; 4 cm reciprocations/min (or equivalent), followed by measurement of a range of elements in the subsequent soil-free extract. It is a rapid, empirical method that offers low soil testing costs by replacing at least three &#8216;traditional&#8217; soil tests.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Across Australasia, method comparisons and field calibration studies with Mehlich 3 mostly involve a 1:10 w/v soil-solution ratio, as in this procedure. This reflects local practice for many empirical soil tests. One reason is that the particle size distribution of a <a id="page_398"></a>wide selection of dry, ground (or crushed) Australian soils of &#60;2 mm can vary considerably, contributing to variability in weights of equal volumes of sub-samples. The US Department of Agriculture (<a href="#ch18ref17">Burt 2004</a>) and Canadians&#8217; <a href="#ch18ref71">Sen Tran and Simard (1993)</a> also specify a w/v soil/solution ratio of 1:10. Approximate results for a v/v soil/solution ratio can be calculated using a weight-volume conversion calculation for each sample.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter18sec07"></a>18F1 Mehlich 3-extractable elements (P, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, B, S, Al)</h3>
<p class="para">Nowadays, the most convenient &#8216;analytical finish&#8217; for all analytes in 1:10 w/v Mehlich 3 extracts of soil involves ICPAES, although other analytical &#8216;finishes&#8217; are used. Expect little difference when AAS is used for soil cations and nutrient heavy metals, provided possible ionisation interference is suppressed with lanthanum solution or similar. In the case of P, expect the <a href="#ch18ref51">Murphy and Riley (1962)</a> analytical finish to yield from zero to &#62;20% lower results than corresponding values obtained from ICPAES (<a href="#ch18ref58">Pierzynski <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>; <a href="#ch18ref72">Sikora <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">There have been many studies comparing results obtained from Mehlich 3 and more &#8216;traditional&#8217; soil chemical tests (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref73">Sims 1989</a>; <a href="#ch18ref06">Anon 2000</a>; <a href="#ch18ref14">Bolland <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>). The summarised findings provided derive from a wide cross-section of fertilised soils from cropped areas of sub-tropical and tropical eastern Australia [<a href="#ch18ref63">Rayment and Bloesch (2006)</a> and unpublished data of Rayment, Bloesch, Lyons and Islam]:</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1">(a) Extractable P: Mehlich 3 lacks good one to one relationships with Colwell P and acid-extractable P (Method 9B and Method 9G, respectively). When soil P fertility rankings were compared, however, Mehlich 3 correctly predicted the expected responsiveness to fertiliser P of &#8805;70% of over 100 sugar cane sites (relative to method 9G), although the amount of P extracted was always lower. Results for Colwell P (Method 9B) were sometimes lower and sometimes higher than Mehlich 3&#8211;P. The Mehlich 3&#8211;P test had the highest correlation with 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable P (Method 9F), which is known to reflect soil solution P concentration. Correlation coefficients (r) with Method 9F were 0.65, 0.47 and 0.45 for Mehlich 3&#8211;P, acid-extractable P, and Colwell P, respectively.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">(b) Cations: Excellent correlations with traditional tests utilising unbuffered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as the exchange cation (e.g. Method 15A1), particularly for acidic and neutral soils.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">(c) Micronutrients: Reasonable correlations with DTPA-extractable Cu and Zn (Method 12A1). For DTPA Mn there were two relationships based on pH. The correlation was reasonable when soil pH was &#60;6.5. For DTPA Fe, there appears to be a good core relationship but the number of outliers resulted in a mediocre net relationship. Generally, Mehlich 3 extracted higher concentrations of micronutrients, particularly Cu and Fe, probably because of the higher acidity of the extracting solution. The relationship with hot CaCl<sub>2-</sub> extractable B (Method 12C2) was acceptable, <a href="#ch18ref78">while Taber (2004)</a> reported useful relationships between Mehlich 3 extractable B and the &#8216;traditional&#8217; hot water method for soil B.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">(d) Extractable S: Excellent correlation with Method 10B3.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Preferably prepare from commercially available single element concentrates. If not available, it is possible to prepare from analytical grade salts as described here-in. As Mixed Working Standards are to be prepared that contain all elements over the concentration ranges of interest, sulfates of Mn, Cu, Fe and Zn should be avoided. Otherwise a separate set of Working Standards would be needed for these trace elements. For these elements, single element concentrates are recommended to keep the number of Working Standards to a more efficient and practical number, particularly for instruments that do a complete calibration of standards at the start of each batch of samples. Avoid storing standards in boroslilcate glass as Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution can extract B from the glass. Store Primary Standards in a clean plastic container. Primary Standards can be prepared in borosilicate glass volumetric flasks provided contact time with Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution is kept to a minimum: Nalgene volumetric flasks are preferred.</p>

Also prepare a suitable selection of P Working Standards &#8211; Mehlich 3 in the same manner, including the same volume of (final) Mehlich 3 Extracting Solution as a reagent blank.

Allow &#8776;20&#8211;25 min for the colour reaction to stabilise, then read and record the transmission/absorbance at 880 nm (2 cm light path probe spectrophotometer) or 882 nm for the standard cuvette-type spectrophotometer within &#60;6 h after addition of the Sulfuric-Molybdate-Tartrate-Ascorbate Working Solution. These steps may be automated, <a id="page_404"></a>taking care to maintain identical ratios of sample solution and reagents and the same sequence of additions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare a calibration curve of absorbance against concentration of standards (or use a regression equation). For samples analysed without any additional dilutions, soil levels can be read directly from the calibration curve in units of mg P/kg. Read concentrations of samples and reagent blanks from the graph.

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter18sec09"></a>18G1 Reserve soil K<sup>+</sup> by copper-modified sodium tetraphenylboron extraction (TBK<sub>4h</sub>)</h3>
<p class="para">It is usual for plants to obtain their K<sup>+</sup> from the soil solution, which in turn is replenished from both exchangeable and non-exchangeable sources within the soil profile (<a href="#ch18ref30">During and Campkin 1980</a>; <a href="#ch18ref47">Metson 1980</a>; <a href="#ch18ref34">Gourley 1999</a>; <a href="#ch18ref49">Moody and Bell 2006</a>). Potassium additions from fertilisers and manures and external losses by leaching and runoff also affect the soil&#8211;plant cycle for K<sup>+</sup>, as diagrammatically shown in <a href="#ch18fig2">Figure 18.2</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Much like Method 18C1 based on boiling 1.0 M HNO<sub>3</sub>, this tetraphenyl boron method targets &#8216;fixed&#8217; soil K<sup>+</sup> reserves, which can be an important source of plant-available K<sup>+</sup>, particularly when soil solution and exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> reserves have been depleted by recent plant growth (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref70">Schulte and Corey 1965</a>; <a href="#ch18ref75">Spencer and Govaars 1982</a>; <a href="#ch18ref36">Jackson 1985</a>; <a href="#ch18ref18">Carey and Metherell 2003a</a>,<a href="#ch18ref19">b</a>; <a href="#ch18ref49">Moody and Bell 2006</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Usually, K<sup>+</sup> is quite soluble in aqueous solutions, once released from exchange and other components of the soil matrix. Likewise, sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) is quite soluble in aqueous solution. When K<sup>+</sup> is introduced into solutions of NaTPB, potassium tetraphenylborate (TBK) forms then precipitates, due to its very low water solubility (1.8 &#215; 10<sup>-4</sup> M). It follows that when NaTPB is used as a soil extractant, there is continual precipitation of K<sup>+</sup>, which helps maintain a low soil solution K<sup>+</sup> concentration that subsequently facilitates release of fixed or reserve K<sup>+</sup> (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref21">Carey <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>). Information on the kinetics of soil K<sup>+</sup> release by NaTPB is available (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref29">Dhillon and Dhillon 1992</a>; <a href="#ch18ref27">Cox and Joern 1997</a>). Potassium tetraphenylborate has the formula C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>20</sub>BK and the structure shown in <a href="#ch18fig3">Figure 18.3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Earlier soil test methods for K<sup>+</sup> based on NaTPB took advantage of the very low aqueous solubility of TBK and its much higher solubility in acetone and other organic solvents (e.g. <a href="#ch18ref36">Jackson 1985</a>). The Jackson test, developed in New Zealand for use on air-dry soils, was shown to be a good predictor of the short-to medium-term availability of soil K<sup>+</sup> for ryegrass. The inclusion of 1:1 acetone/water to re-dissolve precipitated TBK, prior to instrumental analysis, meant it was best used as a supplementary test with small batch sizes.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Later modifications by researchers such as <a href="#ch18ref28">Cox <em>et al.</em> (1996)</a>, <a href="#ch18ref27">Cox and Joern (1997)</a> and <a href="#ch18ref18">Carey and Metherell (2003a</a>,<a href="#ch18ref19">b</a>) improved operational convenience by employing Cu<sup>2+</sup> rather than either acetone or mercuric chloride to destroy the TBK precipitate prior to instrumental analysis for K<sup>+</sup>. The method described, evaluated by <a href="#ch18ref21">Carey <em>et al.</em> (2006)</a>, uses this option, with a 4 h &#8216;incubation time&#8217; for routine use [TPK<sub>4h</sub>]. This choice was made mainly because the concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> released were similar to those obtained by the Jackson test. Other &#8216;incubation times&#8217; include 15 min and 60 min (<a href="#ch18ref20">Carey <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>; <a href="#ch18ref49">Moody and Bell 2006</a>) through to at least 168 h (<a href="#ch18ref84">Winzeler <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>). <a href="#ch18ref18">Carey and Metherell (2003a)</a> reported that across 24 New Zealand soils, &#8776;80% of soil K<sup>+</sup> was released in the presence of excess NaTPB within 48 h, with significant declines after 168 h through to 672 h.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This TPK<sub>4h</sub> test involves use of 1.0 g of air-dry soil and 3.0 mL of Reagent A (a combination of 0.1 M NaTPB/1.7 M NaCl&#8211;0.01 M Na-EDTA), &#8216;incubated&#8217; for 4.0 h at 20&#8211;25&#176;C in a 60 mL boiling tube/flask calibrated at 50 mL. The K-extraction reaction is then halted with 11.5 mL of Reagent B (a combination of 1.0 M CuCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl Reagents in the proportion 1.5 mL to 10 mL, respectively), followed by boiling (or autoclaving at 105&#176;C) for 30 min. Samples are then diluted to 50 mL, after adding 0.5 mL 50% HCl (v/v) (to prevent precipitation of Cu salts) then mixed thoroughly, left to stand overnight to settle particulates, and decanted or filtered and further diluted 1:5 prior to instrumental analysis for K<sup>+</sup>, using AAS, FES or ICPAES.

<p class="indent-para">Dissolve 1.9068 g potassium chloride (KCl; previously dried at 110&#176;C for 2 h) in deionised water and make to 1.0 L in a volumetric flask. Store in a clean, well-sealed plastic bottle.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Potassium Working Standards&#8211;TBK</em></p>
<p class="para">To generate a matrix-matched solution for each of the K Working Standards&#8211;TBK (when each working standard is diluted to 500 mL with deionised water), initially add &#8776;100 mL deionised water to each volumetric flask, followed by 30 mL of TBK Reagent A, 115 mL of TBK Reagent B and 5 mL of 50% HCl v/v, then mix. (These reagents should be from the same batches used for unknown soils.) Next accurately dispense 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mL of K Primary Standard&#8211;TBK into the prepared 500 mL volumetric flasks, mix well and make each to 500 mL with deionised water. Potassium concentrations in Working Standards&#8211;TBK are 0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mg K<sup>+</sup>/L. For a 1:50 soil/extract ratio (and excluding any subsequent dilutions), these Working Standards&#8211;TBK correspond to 0, 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg K<sup>+</sup>/kg of air-dry soil. The Working Standards have a shelf life of 6 months when stored in sealed, polypropylene reagent bottles. Discard if visible mould develops.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) into labelled 60 mL borosilicate boiling tubes/flasks, each with an accurate graduation mark at 50 mL. Also include quality control samples and at least <a id="page_407"></a>two reagent blanks in each batch of 50 samples. Add 3 mL of Reagent A and &#8216;incubate&#8217; the batch of samples at between 20&#8211;25&#176;C for exactly 4 h, preferably with end-over-end mechanical shaking.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Remove from the shaker and add 11.5 mL of Reagent B to each sample, swirl to mix, cover the digest tubes (located in a rack) with clean Al foil, then place the batch of covered samples (in digest tubes) onto a heat-regulated hot plate and boil gently for 30 min (or autoclave at 100&#8211;105&#176;C for 30 min; see Note 2).</p>
<p class="indent-para">After boiling or autoclaving, cool the tubes and contents, then add, without further delay, 0.5 mL of 50% HCl v/v to each tube. Next stir all unknown samples using a vortex mixer (or equivalent) to ensure all of the precipitate of TBK in each digest tubes is thoroughly dissolved. When so, make each to 50 mL with deionised water, stopper and shake.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Allow the samples to stand to ensure a clear supernatant is achieved (this is conveniently achieved by overnight standing: see Note 3).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Carefully and accurately remove 2 mL of extract into clean, small mixing tubes containing 8.0 mL of deionised water and mix well. Do likewise for each K Working Standard&#8211;TBK.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Present diluted K Working Standards&#8211;TBK and diluted soil extracts for instrumental analysis of K<sup>+</sup>. Analyse by FES, AAS, or ICPAES, using procedures similar to those described in Method 15A1/18A1 or as recommended by the instrument manufacturer: see Note 4. For ICPAES, use one of two optional spectral lines (primary wavelength = 769.897 nm; secondary wavelength = 766.491 nm), with 0.5% (w/w) lithium nitrate as the ion suppressant.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Calculation</em></strong></h3>
<p class="center-para">TBK<sub>4th</sub> (mg K<sup>+</sup>/kg air dry) = (mg K/kg in sample) &#8722; (mg K/kg in blank)</p>
<p class="indent-para">Alternatively:</p>
<p class="center-para">TBK<sub>4th</sub> (cmol<sub>c</sub> K<sup>+</sup>/kg air dry) = {[(mg K/kg in sample) &#8722; (mgK/kginblank]/391}</p>
<p class="indent-para">In both of the above, take into account any subsequent dilutions from the initial soil weight and initial extract volume.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report TBK<sub>4h</sub> as either mg K<sup>+</sup>/kg air-dry soil, or as cmol<sub>c</sub>K<sup>+</sup>/kg air-dry soil. Should the &#8216;incubation time&#8217; differ from 4.0 h, then report the actual &#8216;incubation time&#8217;, together with the numeric result. For example, for an &#8216;incubation time&#8217; of 15 min, report as TBK<sub>15min</sub>, followed by the numeric value.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Notes</em></strong></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;The volume is offered only for guidance. It is suggested that operators only prepare the minimum amount of reagent needed at the time, as NaTPB is quite costly. Also, it is essential that operators handle the reagent with care (use protective gloves and work in a fume cupboard) due to the toxicity of the reagent. It is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or if it makes contact with the skin or eyes.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;During local method development, attach one or two Cole Parmer<sup>TM</sup> Irreversible Indicating Temperature Labels designed to operate at 8 points from 71&#8211;110&#176;C to each rack/batch of samples to ensure the correct boiling/autoclaving temperature is consistently achieved. When there is reasonable confidence in temperature settings and times, continue to occasionally (e.g. 3 monthly) monitor temperatures using Cole Parmer<sup>TM</sup> Irreversible Indicating Temperature Labels or similar.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para"><a id="page_408"></a>3.&#160;&#160;It is imperative that the 50 mL sample solution is allowed to stand for sufficient time to achieve particulate-free supernatants. This is to ensure that the final extract solution presented to the measurement instrument does not damage or block the nebuliser.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">4.&#160;&#160;A wide range of cations and anions do not interfere in K<sup>+</sup> extraction and analysis involving NaTPB. A few, such as Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Hg<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>+</sup> and occasional N-containing organic compounds, however, may interfere if present. Interference from sodium perchlorate is unlikely. Lithium nitrate (LiNO<sub>3</sub>) at 0.5% w/w is an effective ion suppressant for axial ICP, although lower concentrations of Li<sup>+</sup> may suffice when using AAS (P Lorentz, pers. comm.).</p>
