<h2 class="h2a">Sulfur</h2>
<p class="para">Sulfur (S) is an essential plant nutrient distributed heterogeneously throughout the earth&#8217;s crust and soils. The element and its compounds exhibit five different oxidation states, including four in geological environments and as S<sup>6</sup> in gases and sulfates (<a href="#ch10ref33">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). Total S concentrations range widely from 3 to over 10 000 mg S/kg, with a mean around 430 mg S/kg. Pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) and pyrrhotite (Fe<sub>n</sub>S<sub>n+1</sub>) are common sulfide minerals, and many of the metals of economic importance occur as sulfides (Ure and Berrow 1982).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Many different forms of organic and inorganic fractions of S occur in soils and in soil OM (<a href="#ch10ref35">Williams 1975</a>). In general, organic S fractions are highly correlated with TOC and TSN. The C/N/organic-S ratio of soils is commonly around 140:10:1.3 (<a href="#ch10ref24">Probert and Samosir 1983)</a>. Long-term studies on cultivated soils, however, have shown a decline in organic S levels of 50% in 20&#8211;30 years (<a href="#ch10ref15">Kamprath and Till 1983</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">In aerobic soils of humid regions, most S is in the organic fraction. As with N, this organically bound S must be mineralised before it becomes available to plants, predominantly as sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>). There are important exceptions, however. For example, sulfides (S<sup>2&#8211;</sup>) predominate in acid-sulfate soils (see <a href="chapter20.html#chapter20">Chapter 20</a>), in recent marine deposits, and in many mining-waste dumps, while elemental S can exist in and around areas of recent volcanic activity and associated soils. Inorganic, solid-phase S (notably gypsum; CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) is very common at the wetting front of soil profiles in semi-arid and arid regions of inland northern Australia (<a href="#ch10ref26">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The reactive surfaces of highly weathered clays and the surfaces of Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides can adsorb relatively large amounts of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, but this propensity decreases as phosphate concentrations increase and as soils become less acidic (<a href="#ch10ref15">Kamprath and Till 1983</a>). Sulfate ions can displace NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> from anion exchange surfaces when present at similar soil solution activities. The chemical activity of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> in soil solutions allows the formation of ionic species such as CaSO<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup> and AlSO<sub>4</sub>1+ (<a href="#ch10ref01">Adams 1974</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The focus of this chapter is on the chemical measurement of soil S, particularly as a plant nutrient. For interpretative information, refer to <a href="#ch10ref19">Lewis (1999)</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Total S</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Measurements of total S are undertaken to assess the size of the soil S pool. Concentrations &#62;0.5% S and certainly &#62;1.0% S also warn of the likely presence of potential or actual ASS (see <a href="chapter20.html#chapter20">Chapter 20</a>). In general, total S is poorly correlated with plant response to applied S fertiliser, except when soil S reserves are very low. Total S is also a poor indicator of a soil&#8217;s tendency to corrode concrete, except at concentrations of &#8805;1% S, particularly under oxidising conditions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two methods for total soil S are included. The first is based on X-ray fluorescence with dry-powder pellets. The second is a combustion furnace method, similar to equivalent <a id="page_206"></a>procedures for TOC and TSN. Both require sophisticated laboratory instrumentation available from several manufacturers.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Wet digestion methods with mineral acids are available but may not always yield quantitative results, because of the possibility of S loss during digestion. If this option is necessary, methods in which oxidation occurs under alkaline conditions are preferred. See wet-digestion methods provided in <a href="chapter17.html#chapter17">Chapter 17</a>, in addition to the suggestions of <a href="#ch10ref25">Randall and Sakai (1983)</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Water-soluble and Adsorbed S</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">The quantity of water-soluble and adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> in the root-zone of soils has a major influence on the incidence of S deficiencies in agriculture (<a href="#ch10ref10">Ensminger 1954</a>; <a href="#ch10ref11">Fox <em>et al.</em> 1964</a>). Water-soluble SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, especially when associated with Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, also promote attack on concrete and other materials containing concrete, whether in the subsurface or at the surface. Gypsum is much less corrosive, unless groundwater in its proximity is continually replenished (<a href="#ch10ref13">Head 1980</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Several extractants have been used to measure &#8216;plant-available&#8217; soil S (e.g. <a href="#ch10ref11">Fox <em>et al.</em> 1964</a>; <a href="#ch10ref22">Peverill and Briner 1974</a>; <a href="#ch10ref02">Andrew 1975</a>; <a href="#ch10ref05">Barrow 1975</a>; <a href="#ch10ref17">Lee <em>et al.</em> 1981</a>; <a href="#ch10ref25">Randall and Sakai 1983</a>). These dominantly contain H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> ions but also include Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<a href="#ch10ref07">Blair <em>et al.</em> 1991</a>). Carrier cations vary. Calcium is preferred by most, because it helps to flocculate colloids, resulting in clearer extracts and less difficulty in interpreting the nature of the extracted S (<a href="#ch10ref25">Randall and Sakai 1983</a>). <a href="#ch10ref32">Spencer (1979)</a> proposed the use of 0.04M magnesium phosphate at pH 5.0 at a 1:20 soil/solution ratio with extraction for 2 h, mainly to improve the extraction of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> from highly weathered Australian soils of high SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> sorption capacity.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch10ref07">Blair <em>et al.</em> (1991)</a> found that 40&#176;C soil extraction with 0.25 M potassium chloride (KCl) at a soil/solution ratio of 1:6.67 for 3 h (KCl-40) favours the removal of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> and labile forms of organic S, which they found attractive from a diagnostic soil-testing viewpoint. There are mixed views as to whether there is need to include decontaminated active charcoal in extracting solutions of 0.01 M calcium dihydrogen phosphate [Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#183;H<sub>2</sub>O], also referred to as MCP.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The chapter includes three principal methods for soil-extractable S (dominantly sulfate), two based on 0.01 M Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, one with and the other without active charcoal. The third method is that of <a href="#ch10ref07">Blair <em>et al.</em> (1991)</a>, involving KCl-40. Several analytical options for the measurement of SO<sub>4</sub>-S are offered, including manual and automated distillation procedures based on <a href="#ch10ref14">Johnson and Nishita (1952)</a>. The others are ICPAES and IC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Mehlich 3 multi-element extraction, followed by analysis by ICPAES (Method 18F1) extends the options available for extractable S. The test correlates strongly with Method 10B3 (D Lyons, unpublished data).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Soil preparation</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Soil samples for S, irrespective of test, are best kept at &#8804;4&#176;C during transport to the laboratory, where they are usually dried, ground, sieved and stored before analysis. These processes enable soils to be analysed for a wide range of elements in addition to S.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is evidence (<a href="#ch10ref28">Rayment 1993</a>) that levels of phosphate-extractable S in air-dry soils are affected by storage conditions. For example, concentrations increased in storage for about 13 weeks then decreased slightly over the following 20 weeks to levels 2.5 to 3 times higher than those present immediately following air drying (<a href="#ch10ref31">Spencer 1974</a>). Unpublished data (GE Rayment and GA Barry) for phosphate-extractable S in soils from established pastures in south-east Queensland confirm that increases do occur, particularly in surface soils with good reserves of OC. Low temperature storage (3&#176;C) did not prevent changes occurring in apparent soil S status (<a href="#ch10ref31">Spencer 1974</a>). Clearly, there is a need for caution when using stored samples for soil test calibrations and other purposes.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>S Methods Summary</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><a href="#ch10tab1">Table 10.1</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter for measuring total soil S and extractable soil S. More details on each of these are covered in method preambles. Examples of laboratory measurement performance, where available, are summarised in <a href="backmatter02.html#backmatter02">Appendix 2</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter10sec01"></a><strong>10A1 Total S &#8211; X-ray fluorescence</strong></h3>
<p class="para">This X-ray fluorescence method is based on techniques similar to those described for total P (Method 9A1). There are no recent inter-laboratory proficiency data from ASPAC for this test. According to <a href="#ch10ref34">Vempati <em>et al.</em> (1996)</a>, quantitative analysis by XRF could have uncertainty of 10% relative to the measured value: see <a href="backmatter02.html#backmatter02">Appendix 2</a>. Note that Method 17A1 provides an alternative multi-elemental XRF option that uses modern instrumentation. Both total S and total P could be included in the multi-element suite.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter10sec02"></a><strong>10A2 Total soil S &#8211; high-temperature combustion</strong></h3>
<p class="para">Total soil S, inclusive of sulfate and sulfide, can be determined by catalysed, high temperature combustion, simultaneously with measurement of TOC and TSN. This method is based on the detection of S, after the combustion of the sample in a stream of O<sub>2</sub>, with the S released and converted to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). The use of vanadium pentoxide (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) as an accelerant ensures the decomposition and release of inorganic S into the gas stream. The method is both rapid and convenient but does require reliable instrumentation, now available from a range of manufacturers.</p>
<p class="indent-para">From a workplace health and safety perspective, laboratories that employ O<sub>2</sub>-enriched, high temperature combustion methods must take precautions to prevent burns and fires, and also while handling compressed gases. As O<sub>2</sub> is highly inflammable, avoid open flames and sparks and have a fire blanket and an appropriate fire extinguisher close to hand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method described (as an example) is based on use of a LECO<sup>&#8482;</sup> CNS-2000 multi-functional analyser. A sample is weighed and accelerant added before being ignited in a stream of O<sub>2</sub> gas at 1350&#176;C. Water vapour is removed and the combustion gases are collected and equilibrated. The amount of S released is measured quantitatively (as SO<sub>2</sub>) using IR detection. The instrument is calibrated against a reference standard (in this case sulfamethazine), with the total S reported as % S. No local measurement performance data are available.</p>

<p class="para">Follow manufacturer&#8217;s instructions to calibrate the analyser and to prepare it for total S analysis. Instrument calibration involves analysing the one standard (sulfamethazine) many times at varying weights, using each result to calculate the best-fit curve and store in memory. The calibration (graph/curve) should not change but the standard values obtained in any set of analysis may drift from the certified value. Once a trend is confirmed, a <em>Drift Correction</em> can be made and, if needed, previous samples recalculated: see Note 1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Routinely for a 0.2 g soil sample, allocate &#8216;blanks&#8217; to a nominated weight of 0.2 g. (When the Blank ID is selected, press Manual Weight, type in 0.200 and then hit enter. Don&#8217;t use a boat or V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> for blanks but remember to leave a space in the Autoloader rack.)</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_211"></a>Weigh (typically) 0.2 g finely-ground (&#60;0.5 mm) of air-dry (40&#176;C) soil into a combustion boat then combine with two standard scoops (&#8776;1.0 g) of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> as an accelerant, taking care not to create any dust, then place in the Autoloader rack for analysis.

<p class="indent-para">Analyse 3 blanks to warm up the system and to check the IR cell baseline voltage (peak value), then analyse 5 standards (Sulfamethazine: &#8776;0.05 g) to establish and check the existing calibration. After analysing the fifth standard, run another 2 blanks.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Commence analysing soil samples when all instrument operating parameters are within specifications. As a further check on analytical performance, analyse one sample in duplicate for each batch of 12 to 15 samples. In addition, analyse 3 calibration standards followed by 2 blanks between each batch of unknowns, and at the end of each batch.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Note that when each analysis is complete, the result is momentarily displayed on the instrument&#8217;s screen and the data printed out. The Autoloader then removes the finished sample from the furnace, loads up the next sample and begins the analysis sequence again. The LECO&#8482; CNS-2000 will continue to analyse samples without further prompting, so long as there are weights present in the Weight Stack and the sample in the 49th position has not been analysed.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Once the sample in the 49th position has been analysed, that sample boat is removed from the furnace and all further analysis is halted. The operator must touch Analyse to recommence the analysis process. At run&#8217;s end, turn all the gases off at the bench top, cylinder and back-flow valves.

<p class="para">Two different methods utilise 0.01 M Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> as the extractant for soil S, one with and the other without activated charcoal. The method with charcoal (10C1) with the acronym (CPC-S) is used predominantly in Victoria, where it has been correlated with responses of local pastures to applications of S fertiliser (<a href="#ch10ref22">Peverill and Briner 1974</a>). The other, with analytical finishes coded as Methods 10B1, 10B2 and 10B3 in <a href="#ch10ref29">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a> and similarly in this chapter has been more widely adopted (e.g. <a href="#ch10ref30">Rayment 1983</a>, <a href="#ch10ref27">1984</a>). There is also an IC option (Method 10B4). Moreover, measurement performance for over a decade, particularly for Method 10B3 (see <a href="#ch10fig1">Figure 10.1</a>), is available from ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs, such as those reported by <a href="#ch10ref23">Peverill and Johnstone (1997)</a> and <a href="#ch10ref20">Lyons <em>et al.</em> (2008)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Manual distillation (<a href="#ch10ref14">Johnson and Nishita 1952</a>) and automated distillation are analytical options but are relatively slow and expensive to perform.

An additional pump tube to supply deionised water such that the new sample volume plus water is equivalent to the original 0.8 mL/min should be added prior to the first mixing coil. Also extend the range of SO<sub>4</sub>-S Working Standards.</p>

<p class="para">ICPAES, in conjunction with vacuum-purged optics, provides an efficient alternative for the measurement of S in soil extracts.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Comparative testing (GA Barry, GE Rayment and DJ Lyons, unpublished data) has shown that use of ICPAES for the measurement of S in 0.01 M Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> extracts gives results that are highly correlated with those obtained by Method 10B2. However, as ICPAES measures total S in the 0.01 M Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> extracts, including some that may avoid detection by <a id="page_219"></a>Johnson-Nishita distillation, slightly higher S values can be expected for most soils. For a range of soils from Queensland, a value of 5 mg S/kg by Method 10B2 may increase to around 7 mg S/kg. At very high levels of phosphate-extractable S, wider differences can occur, but these are well beyond the range likely to be associated with S deficiency in plants.</p>

For more details on the two competing IC technologies, see Methods 5A3a and 5A3b. The option described is based on chemically suppressed IC. The suppressor cartridge, packed with a high capacity cation exchange resin, chemically suppresses the background conductance of the eluent. It also converts the anionic species into species of higher conductance prior to the conductivity detector.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Initialise the suppressor. Use a tube of deionised water in rack position No. 1 and the Single Run command to put a flush sample through to ensure the eluent has come right through.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Load the autosampler with standard solutions and soil extracts and commence the analyses on a batch by batch basis by injecting a known volume of the filtered extract (same volume as used for the calibration solution/s).

<p class="indent-para">Finally, shut down the IC system as recommended by the manufacturer and process the results by evaluating peak height or peak area as required for comparison with relevant calibration standards.</p>

<p class="para">Dilute calcium dihydrogen phosphate [0.01 M Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.0] and activated charcoal are used to extract water-soluble and adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> from the air-dry soil matrix, thereby providing an empirical assessment of &#8216;available&#8217; soil S (CPC-S). This extracting solution, developed by <a href="#ch10ref21">Peverill and Briner (1974)</a>, and <a href="#ch10ref21">Peverill (1976)</a> and incorporating a 1:4 soil/solution ratio and an extraction time of 1 h, originally used the distillation method of <a href="#ch10ref14">Johnson and Nishita (1952)</a> for its analytical finish. Nowadays, however, ICPAES is preferred. Activated charcoal is included during soil extraction, as the method&#8217;s developers reported its inclusion removed organic S fractions, thus improving the correlation between test results and the response of southern Australian pastures to applications of S fertiliser.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method, which has most use in Victoria, is similar to Method 10B3 of <a href="#ch10ref29">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a> and Method 10B3 in this chapter. Lower values of phosphate-extractable S must be expected, however, because of the removal of at least some organic S, and as a consequence of the narrower soil/solution ratio (1:4 cf 1:5) and the shorter extraction time (1 h cf 17 h). It is essential to ensure the activated charcoal is sufficiently free of S to prevent any measurable transfer to the extracting solution.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_222"></a>Analysts should achieve a within-laboratory detection limit of 1 mg S/kg, based on 3 times the standard deviation of 10 determinations of process blanks. The reporting range is from 3 to 200 mg S/kg, with higher values reported as &#62;200 mg S/kg for routine soil testing purposes. The soil/extractant ratio of 1:4 must be maintained, should a lower soil weight than specified become necessary because of a limited supply of sample.
