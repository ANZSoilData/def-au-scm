<h2 class="h2a">Carbon/nitrogen ratio</h2>
<p class="para">The rate of decomposition of soil OM and the amount of humus formed are related to the soil&#8217;s TOC to TSN ratio (C/N ratio). As decomposition of OM typically increases as soil C/N ratios decrease, the ratio of these two essential elements is recognised as a useful index of soil fertility (e.g. <a href="#ch08ref06">Owen <em>et al.</em> 1950</a>; <a href="#ch08ref03">Jones and Parsons 1970</a>; <a href="#ch08ref07">Post and Mann 1990</a>; <a href="#ch08ref04">Knops and Tilman 2000</a>). It follows that the C/N ratio of OM added to moist soil reflects the likely rate of OM decomposition and ultimately whether there is subsequent release (mineralisation) or immobilisation of soil N.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Organic matter breakdown is a complex process. Decomposition involves chemical alteration of OM, physical fragmentation and finally release of mineral nutrients. This process is facilitated by soil biota, including micro-organisms and earthworms, which are influenced by the amount of N present. Soil microbes that attack OM have a C/N ratio of &#8776;8:1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Organic compounds readily decomposed by soil micro-organisms include amino acids and simple sugars. Cellulose, phenols, waxes and lignins resist decomposition, so remain for longer times and often accumulate in soils with wide C/N ratios.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Very high C/N ratios (&#62;25&#8211;30) indicate OM accumulation is occurring or has occurred faster than decomposition. These high ratios are observed in peats and forest litters. Ligneous tissue of trees can have a C/N ratio up to &#8776;1000:1. Soil C/N ratios from &#8776;12&#8211;16 suggest OM is well broken down. Good cropping soils usually have a C/N ratio of 10&#8211;12. Ratios below 10 and as close as 5:1 are normally confined to subsoils containing &#8216;fixed&#8217; non-exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#43;</sup> (<a href="#ch08ref02">Cooke 1967</a>), or may reflect very heavy fertilisation with N and/or inputs of N-rich materials such as poultry manure. For further information, see <a href="#ch08ref01">Brady (1990)</a> and <a href="#ch08ref05">Millar and Donahue (1990)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Because reported soil concentrations of TOC (%C) and TSN (%N) are influenced by the methods employed, apparent C/N ratios, which are calculated on a weight rather than an equivalence basis, will also be affected. For this reason, it is important to give details of the analytical methods employed in the calculation of C/N ratio. Measurement uncertainty is a function of how well the C and N methods are analysed. It is usual to report C/N ratios as whole numbers or at most to one decimal place, without units. Summary details on each method are provided in <a href="#ch8tab1">Table 8.1</a>.</p>
