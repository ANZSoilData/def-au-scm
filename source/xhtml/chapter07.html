<h2 class="h2a">Nitrogen</h2>
<p class="para">Nitrogen (N) is present in all living matter and is a major constituent of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere, where it is enriched relative to the earth&#8217;s crust 3:1 by weight. It occurs in intrusive and igneous rocks, largely as &#8216;fixed&#8217; ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), with an average content in igneous rocks of 37 mg N/kg (<a href="#ch07ref69">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). <a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner (1996)</a> reported that the total soil N (TSN) content of soils ranges from &#60;0.02% in subsoils to &#62;2.5% in peats, while the plough layer of cultivated soils often contains between 0.02&#8211;0.5% N, with a global mean of 0.2% N (<a href="#ch07ref13">Bowen 1979</a>; <a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner 1996</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Most soil N is associated with organic compounds including proteinaceous forms from plant, animal and microbiological residues. These and all other forms of soil N can undergo chemical and biological transformations under appropriate conditions. Important inorganic combined forms of soil N involved in these reactions include nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>&#8211;) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>) (<a href="#ch07ref69">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). The latter three ionic forms constitute the &#8216;mineral N&#8217; component of TSN.</p>
<p class="indent-para">From a land-use and soil fertility viewpoint, the TSN and &#8216;mineral N&#8217; components are of particular interest. Nitrate and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> are important sources of N for plant growth, while TSN provides a measure of the quantity of N that can be &#8216;mineralised&#8217; by micro-organisms. In addition, use of the Haber-Bosch process during the past century of synthetically transforming atmospheric N to NH<sub>3</sub> has accelerated the amounts and forms of N added to soils as synthetic fertilisers. Urea, NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> are the main forms of N in commercial mineral fertilisers.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch07ref46">Metson (1961)</a>, <a href="#ch07ref12">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1987</a>), <a href="#ch07ref17">Bruce and Rayment (1982)</a> and <a href="#ch07ref05">Anon (2001)</a> have independently provided ratings for TSN relevant to New Zealand and Australia (<a href="#ch7tab1">Table 7.1</a>). It is postulated that the low organic N status of many Australian soils is related to their naturally low P and S status (<a href="#ch07ref37">Ladd and Russell 1983</a>). These authors also report that for six major soil groups from South Australia, TSN concentrations ranged from 0.04&#8211;0.22% N by weight (average of 0.12% N), of which about 3.2% (geometric mean) was biomass N. Australia&#8217;s National Land and Water Resources Audit (<a href="#ch07ref05">Anon 2001</a>) reported that the lowest levels of TSN (&#60;0.1% N) are usually associated with rangelands, with highest levels (&#62;0.2% N) found in forest and cultivated soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The surface horizons of 11 New Zealand reference soils compiled by <a href="#ch07ref71">Vortman (1980</a>) ranged from 0.09&#8211;0.87% N (Kjeldahl method; median 0.33% N), with median concentrations at around 50 and 100 cm in the same soils of 0.06 and 0.02% N, respectively. The modelled distribution of TSN by weight in topsoils for different Australian land uses have been tabulated by <a href="#ch07ref05">Anon (2001)</a>. Ants and termites also play a role in the soil N cycle (<a href="#ch07ref38">Lobry de Bruyn and Conacher 1990</a>).</p>

<p class="indent-para1">While TSN measurements are essential in mass-balance studies and also provide a general indication of the quality of soil OM, they are rarely a good predictor of the responsiveness of crops to N fertiliser applications (<a href="#ch07ref67">Strong and Mason 1998</a>). Those authors reported that NO<sub>3</sub>-N was commonly a more useful predictor of fertiliser-N requirements, particularly for crops such as cotton, maize, oats, sorghum and wheat grown under Australian conditions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The reliable measurement of TSN is analytically challenging. This is due partly to the ability of N to transform itself from one chemical species to another (e.g. protein N to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, to NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211; and vice versa) and from gaseous, aqueous, adsorbed and absorbed phases and vice versa. In brief, the N cycle in soil, in which microbes play crucial roles, include fixation, mineralisation, nitrification, leaching, denitrification and plant uptake. These transformations and their reaction rates are influenced by temperature, moisture, soil biological activity, plant species, and soil fertility status, including pH. The fact that transformations can occur during transport of samples to the laboratory, during drying and preparation of samples for analysis, and even during the analytical process (from dust and volatile NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> fumes in particular) adds to the challenge.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is considerable literature on the sampling and subsequent treatment of soils prior to N analysis, which takes account of the N cycle and the variable distribution of N in soils (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref59">Rayment and Pulsford 1974</a>; <a href="#ch07ref23">Etchevers 1986</a>). In common with C, concentrations of soil N vary with depth, with totals almost always highest in the plough layer, followed by an exponential decline with soil depth (<a href="#ch07ref05">Anon 2001</a>). The reverse, however, can apply to NO<sub>3</sub>-N due to leaching of native and fertiliser N, at least to the subsoil&#8217;s long-term wetting front. Accordingly, soil sampling depth is an important pre-laboratory variable.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Excluding in-field extractions immediately after sampling, which <a href="#ch07ref33">Keeney and Nelson (1982)</a> prefer for valid results for inorganic forms of N, soil samples should be kept clean and at &#8804;4&#176;C during transport to the laboratory, where they are usually dried, ground and perhaps sieved and stored before analysis. According to <a href="#ch07ref16">Bremner and Mulvaney (1982)</a>, it is unlikely that air drying will significantly affect subsequent results for inorganic N, when soils contain low percentages (e.g. 1&#8211;3%) of this fraction of TSN, and when drying occurs in the absence of NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> vapours or aerosols. Air drying (temperatures &#8804;40&#8211;45&#176;C) or oven drying (to &#8776;105&#176;C) of soils containing unusually large amounts of inorganic N, however, may lead to significant transformations and/or losses of N. Drying soils at temperatures &#62;45&#176;C for mineral-N analyses is not recommended (unless there are biosecurity concerns; see <a href="#ch07ref56">Rayment 2006</a>), as N-transformations such as an elevation in apparent NH<sub>4</sub>-N status, loss of NO<sub>2</sub>-N, and changes either way in apparent NO<sub>3</sub>-N status can occur (<a href="#ch07ref59">Rayment and Pulsford 1974</a>; <a href="#ch07ref54">Rayment 1993</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_95"></a>Fine grinding to &#60;0.15 mm or &#60;0.5 &#956;m helps to lessen soil heterogeneity, particularly for TSN, when samples weights of &#60;1.0 g are presented for analysis. Thereafter, the dry samples can usually be stored for prolonged periods in closed plastic or glass containers. Several investigators have shown that prolonged storage of air-dry soils in paper containers open to the atmosphere can result in significant increases in exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub>-N (<a href="#ch07ref33">Keeney and Nelson 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch7tab2">Table 7.2</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter for measuring TSN, mineral N fractions, and potentially mineralisable N. Further information on each method category is provided under a series of minor headings.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Total (and Approximate Total) Soil-N</em></h3>
<p class="para">Guided by <a href="#ch07ref57">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, Code 7A defines methods for TSN. These embrace three different measurement technologies; viz. wet oxidation, dry combustion (Dumas N), and IR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The third digit and fourth letter identify method modifications that deal with the presence of significant NO<sub>3</sub>-N and different measurement technologies.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Wet oxidation technology (<a href="#ch07ref34">Kjeldahl 1883</a>), has wide acceptance (<a href="#ch07ref16">Bremner and Mulvaney 1982</a>; <a href="#ch07ref20">Craft <em>et al.</em> 1991</a>). Nitrogen in the sample is converted to NH<sub>4</sub>-N by digestion in the presence of a catalyst, with heating to &#8776;420&#176;C. Distillation/titration or colorimetric determinations of the NH<sub>4</sub>-N present or formed (three methodological options) are used to complete the measurement of TSN, following wet oxidation. Choice of analytical &#8216;finish&#8217; should not significantly affect results, although the technologies are identified by different codes for tracking purposes. <a href="#ch07ref03">Amin and Flowers (2004)</a> have undertaken a contemporary assessment of Kjeldahl methodology.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Unless precautions are taken, Kjeldahl digestion does not ensure quantitative recovery of all forms of soil N, particularly from some heterocyclic compounds and in substances with N-N and N-O bonds (<a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner 1996</a>). Adequate recoveries are usually achieved but when complete recoveries are essential and when soil NO<sub>3</sub>-N is known to exceed around 0.002%, the sodium thiosulfate-salicylic acid modification of the Kjeldahl digestion procedure should be employed (Method 7A3).</p>
<p class="indent-para">There are also questions about the ability of Kjeldahl digestion to fully recover indigenous, clay-fixed NH<sub>4</sub>-N (<a href="#ch07ref66">Stewart and Porter 1963</a>). As Australian soils are generally low in this N fraction (<a href="#ch07ref42">Martin <em>et al.</em> 1970</a>, <a href="#ch07ref11">Black and Waring 1972</a>) any associated analytical errors should be inconsequential.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nowadays, dry, high-temperature combustion systems (Dumas) offer a robust alternative to Kjeldahl digestion for the measurement of TSN. Indeed, a range of manufacturers have developed automated and/or microprocessor controlled instruments, which mostly are able to measure at least total C, N and S in the same sample. For examples of manufacturers, operating principles and typical applications, see Table 1 of <a href="#ch07ref65">Smith and Tabatabai (2004)</a>. The technology is suited to <sup>15</sup>N tracer studies. Dumas N dry oxidation includes all forms of N, without the need for lengthy pretreatments (<a href="#ch07ref07">Bellomonte <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>). Tests on fully automatic equipment should take around 3&#8211;5 min each to perform. Practical quantitation limits depend on the amount of sample used but are typically around 0.01&#8211;0.02% TSN.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Analytically, finely ground soil samples (&#8804;0.5 mm) of known weight are sequentially introduced into an oxidation furnace and subjected to flash combustion from about 900&#8211;1350&#176;C in a stream of O<sub>2</sub>, releasing N<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and other gases. These gases then pass into a reduction furnace containing Cu at about 650&#176;C, which removes excess O<sub>2</sub> and converts NO<sub>x</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>, noting that CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour are absorbed in chemical traps (usually in anhydrone tubes). The N<sub>2</sub> gas is separated from residual imputities and quantified, commonly by thermal conductivity (<a href="#ch07ref43">McGill and Figueiredo 1993</a>). As with soil C and because multiple elements may be analysed concurrently, analytical cleanliness and freedom from detectable impurities are essential, particularly to prevent positive errors at low elemental concentrations. Similarly, soil sampling and grinding equipment should be free of oil/waxes and corrosion inhibitors, as these substances can transfer impurities to the sample (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref22">Dowling <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>), including C that is often measured simultaneously with TSN.</p>

<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_98"></a>In common with other high temperature combustion instrumentation, the analyst must take precautions to prevent burns and fires, and also while handling compressed gases. Certainly avoid open flames and sparks and have a fire blanket and an appropriate fire extinguisher close to hand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">As an alternative to direct measurement, TSN can be &#8216;predicted&#8217; by mathematical relationships established between both NIR and MIR reflectance spectroscopy and conventionally measured TSN concentrations (<a href="#ch07ref29">Janik <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>; <a href="#ch07ref47">Meyer 1998</a>; <a href="#ch07ref41">Malley <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#ch07ref45">Merry and Janik 2001</a>). These non-destructive techniques are coded as 7A6a and 7A6b, respectively. They create no adverse environmental wastes and can have very good precision, but accuracy depends on confirming highly significant correlations between conventionally measured TSN concentrations. Generic calibration datasets require comprehensive local validation prior to routine use.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Other than in research papers dealing with the use of IR reflectance spectroscopy, comparative data on this technology relative to &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods of chemical analysis for TSN has still to emerge. Comparative data for Method 7A2 based on Kjeldahl digestion (not modified to include all NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and by Dumas high-temperature combustion (Method 7A5) are available from ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs. Across 72 finely ground reference soils ranging from around 0.01&#8211;0.58% N, the grand median for Method 7A2 was 0.116% N, compared with 0.120% N for Method 7A5, which approximates to 1:1.007. How robust coefficients of variation can be expected to vary continuously with increasing TSN concentrations by the two methods are shown in <a href="#ch7fig1">Figure 7.1</a>. The data are from laboratories across Australasia that participated in ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007 (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref52">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch07ref58">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Mineral-N</em></h3>
<p class="para">The measurement of NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N in soils must be undertaken with close attention to detail, noting air drying invalidates results for NO<sub>2</sub>-N (<a href="#ch07ref33">Keeney and Nelson 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Water or salt solutions are suitable extractants for NO<sub>3</sub>-N (and NO<sub>2</sub>-N) across the great majority of soils, although water may fail to extract all NO<sub>3</sub>-N held weakly on positively-charged surfaces of variably charged soil colloids. In terms of quanties that can be adsorbed, anion exchange capacities up to 3.5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg have been measured in subsoils of highly weathered soils derived from basalt in the Tully&#8211;Innisfail area of North Queensland (<a href="#ch07ref27">Gillman and Abel 1987</a>). Chloride will readily replace this adsorbed NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211;.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 7.1.</strong> Soil TSN concentrations by two methods vs % robust CVs.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_99"></a>As (potentially) a monovalent exchangeable base, NH<sub>4</sub>-N must be displaced from the surface of negatively charged soil colloids with another cation, commonly K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>. The unionised form (NH<sub>3</sub>) is increasingly likely to be present when soil pH values exceed pH 9.0. Once extracted, NH<sub>4</sub>-N, NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NO<sub>2</sub>-N can be determined conveniently by steam distillation/titration or by automated colorimetric procedures. More details are given in preambles to these methods.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ion chromatography provides an alternative, reliable, yet relatively slow analytical finish for water-soluble NO<sub>3</sub>-N in the mg/kg concentration range, simultaneously with other common soil anions (an analytical positive). The need to inject a finely-filtered aliquot (&#60;0.45 &#956;m with &#60;0.20 &#956;m membrane filter preferred) of the 1:5 soil/water extract into the IC, unless automated, adds to laboratory-operator time and effort. Extracts with elevated EC levels also need to be diluted. See Australian Standard AS 3741 (<a href="#ch07ref04">Anon 1990</a>) and to the preamble to water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Method 5A3a for more details on IC technology, which does avoid the need to use hazardous reagents during analysis (<a href="#ch07ref06">APHA 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Choice of method for components of soil mineral-N is largely an issue of preference and the laboratory&#8217;s level of instrumental sophistication and operator training. Another consideration is analytical performance, albeit little comparative data are available from Australasia. The continuous relationships (see <a href="#ch7fig2">Figure 7.2</a>) for NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations, respectively, and % robust CVs derive from ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007 (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref52">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch07ref58">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Ion selective electrodes for both NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N offer an alternative measurement technology. Details are not included, however, as both electrodes can suffer from serious interferences [e.g. K<sup>+</sup> interferes strongly with the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> electrode, while several anions can interfere &#8211; electrode (<a href="#ch07ref48">Mulvaney 1996</a>)]. Several Australian soil testing services in the 1960s&#8211;1970s did use the NO<sub>3</sub>-N ion selective electrode for both diagnostic and research purposes, but confidence in the accuracy of results at the time was low.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Potentially mineralisable-N (PMN)</em></h3>
<p class="para">Estimates of how much soil N will be released as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub>&#8211; (forms that can be utilised by plant roots) are challenged by the dynamic nature of soil N. Temperature, moisture and soil biology all have an influence in releasing mineral-N from OM. Therefore, it is not surprising many chemical and bio-chemical methods have been developed in efforts to quantify PMN or contributing components (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref14">Bremner, 1965</a>; <a href="#ch07ref01">Adams and Attiwill 1986</a>; <a href="#ch07ref39">Lowe 1993</a>; <a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>; <a href="#ch07ref75">Wang <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch07ref49">Mulvaney <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch07ref35">Kliese <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). No indicies have achieved universial success, yet estimates of PMN can help guide the need for N fertilisers.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 7.2.</strong> Concentrations of soil mineral-N components vs % robust CVs.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_100"></a><em>In situ</em> techniques are often used to estimate expected net N mineralisation (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref53">Raison <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>). Constraints of these and laboratory-based incubation methods include the lengthy time they take, often multiple days under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Chemical methods are more convenient for soil testing services, with rapidity their main attribute.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Two laboratory-based methods for PMN are included. The first is a chemical procedure that utilises hot-KC1 extraction, as this has been shown to correlate with biological methods (<a href="#ch07ref25">Gianello and Bremner 1986a</a>,<a href="#ch07ref26">b</a>; <a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>). Extraction conditions, however, are inconsistent with respect to temperature and extraction time, which range from 100&#176;C for 2&#8211;4 h (<a href="#ch07ref25">Gianello and Bremner 1986a</a>; <a href="#ch07ref73">Walley <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#ch07ref08">Benbi and Haer 2007</a>) to 90&#176;C for 16&#8211;20 h (<a href="#ch07ref51">&#216;ien and Selmer-Olsen 1980</a>; <a href="#ch07ref74">Wang <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>), with 90&#176;C for 16 h preferred for soils containing high concentrations of OM. <a href="#ch07ref44">McTaggart and Smith (1993)</a> showed there was a good correlation between hot KC1-extractable N and N uptake by barley; however <a href="#ch07ref21">Curtin <em>et al.</em> (2006)</a>, working with 30 soils from New Zealand, found hot water-extractable N to be superior to hot 2 M KCl as a chemical predictor of PMN. It is an advantage that the method is not-appreciably affected by air drying or by air-dry storage of soil samples (<a href="#ch07ref25">Gianello and Bremner 1986a</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The second PMN method utilises anaerobic incubation in the laboratory for seven days, based broadly on the methods of <a href="#ch07ref76">Waring and Bremner (1964</a>) and <a href="#ch07ref32">Keeney and Bremner (1966</a>). The method to obtain an index of PMN to plants relies on estimation of the NH<sub>4</sub>-N formed, relative to that originally present, when soil is incubated in water for seven days and subsequently extracted by 2 M KCl. This test uses field-moist soils that need to be handled carefully between sampling and preparation for analysis to minimise ongoing N transformations. The method is unsuitable for use on air-dried soils.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Digest and distil a reagent blank (see Note 1) with each batch of assays, using distillation apparatus similar to that shown in <a href="#ch7fig3">Figure 7.3</a>. Weigh 1.00 g of finely-ground (&#60;0.5 mm), air dry soil into a 100 mL Kjeldahl digestion flask (see Note 2). Add 2.0 mL deionised water and, after swirling for a few minutes, allow to stand for 30 min. Add 2.2 g catalyst mixture (or two catalyst tablets) and 6.5 mL of digest acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). Heat flasks cautiously in a fume cupboard or with an attached fume extractor until water is lost and frothing has ceased. Increase heat so that H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> condenses about one-third way up the neck of the digestion flasks. Continue boiling for 2 h after the soil has become bleached. On completion of digestion, cool, then add slowly and with swirling, about 30 mL deionised water to prevent solidification of the digest solution on complete cooling. There is no requirement to dilute to a known volume.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Prepare the distillation apparatus (<a href="#ch7fig3">Figure 7.3</a>; see Note 3) by adding 10.0 mL of 2% H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> to each 100 mL borosilicate beaker or flask. Place the beaker under the condenser outlet so the end of the condenser is just below the surface of the H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> solution. Carefully add &#8776;25&#8211;30 mL 60% NaOH Solution to each digestion flask and quickly attach the flask to the distillation unit; the solution should be distinctly alkaline, commonly indicated by the formation of a brown precipitate of ferric hydroxide &#8211; (Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>). Distil for 5 min at a distillation rate of &#8776;8 mL/min until at least 30 mL are collected. Lower the beaker so the condenser tip is above the solution and rinse the end of the condenser with deionised water. Remove flasks and stop distillation. Temperature of the distillate should not exceed 40&#176;C to prevent loss of N as NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add 5&#8211;6 drops of the mixed indicator and titrate the distillate with standardised 0.01 M HCl. The end-point is indicated by a colour change from pale green to faint pink.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec02"></a>7A2a Total soil-N, semi micro Kjeldahl &#8211; automated colour, continuous segmented flow</h3>
<p class="para">Segmented, continuous flow analysis technology is broadly described elsewhere (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref28">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>; Section 4120 of <a href="#ch07ref06">APHA 2005</a>). The SFA herein outlined is an example based on AutoAnalyzer I/II technology. It is recognised, however, that improvements in system performance are ongoing, including faster rates of analysis, lower reagent volumes, more reliability, automatic data handling, sample dilution and speedier reagent change-over. Reductions in dispersion have centred on smaller internal diameters of reaction tubing, down from 2.4 mm in the Technicon AutoAnalyzer I, to 2 mm in the AutoAnalyzer II, and to 1 mm in more modern instruments (<a href="#ch07ref30">Jodo <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>). The latest systems incorporate a better understanding of the way in which dispersion, tubing diameter and flow rate are interrelated (<a href="#ch07ref28">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">To accommodate the automated colorimetric finish, the Kjeldahl digest described in Method 7A1 is diluted to a known volume. The NH<sub>4</sub>-N and any free amino acids in diluted digest solutions are measured colorimetrically at 660 nm by the nitroprusside/dichloro-S-triazine modification (<a href="#ch07ref62">Searle 1975</a>; <a href="#ch07ref12">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) of the Berthelot indophenol reaction reviewed by <a href="#ch07ref63">Searle (1984)</a>. Free amino groups that can react are most likely to be present in soils that have been fumigated or dried at elevated temperatures (<a href="#ch07ref18">Burton <em>et al.</em> 1989</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The continuous flow instrumentation uses a peristaltic pump to draw sample extracts from the sampler into a manifold designed to mix the samples with reagents that are being pumped at predetermined flow rates, and on eventually to the colorimeter detector. It is acknowledged that the analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method.</p>

<p class="para">The method described is a modified semi-micro Kjeldahl procedure (<a href="#ch07ref12">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) in which digestion occurs in 50 mL calibrated test tubes in a drilled Al metal block on a hotplate. Concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> plus anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is used to raise the distillation temperature to &#8776;375&#8211;400&#176;C, with Cu as a catalyst. The effect over a few hours is to convert complexed N in soil samples to NH<sub>4</sub>-N. Use of a heating block with a maximum temperature option of 400&#176;C helps prevent possible N loss from overheating.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Ammonium and any free amino acid in the digest solution (after making to volume) are determined by the colorimetric Berthelot reaction utilising FIA. Such systems typically operate at high sensitivity. This automated technology involves introducing, under the force of a peristaltic pump, a precisely measured volume of liquid sample from the sampler into a continuously flowing carrier stream. An injection valve with a fixed-volume sample loop or an injection valve with a fixed time period determines the injected volume of sample. A carrier stream sweeps the sample out of the loop and into the manifold where it disperses. The concentration gradient formed is detected continuously by (in this case) a colour reaction that occurs in the presence of continuously flowing reaction solutions. Refer to Section 4130 of <a href="#ch07ref06">APHA 2005</a> for further details of the technology.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Specifically, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> reacts with hypochlorite ions that are generated <em>in situ</em> by alkaline hydrolysis of sodium dichloroisocyanurate. This reaction forms monochloramine, which then reacts with salicylate ions in the presence of sodium nitroprusside to form a blue, indophenol-type compound that absorbs strongly at 660 nm. A citrate buffer is employed to chelate metals that would otherwise form insoluble hydroxides or carbonates. Free amino groups that can react are most likely to be present in soils that have been fumigated or dried at elevated temperatures (<a href="#ch07ref18">Burton <em>et al.</em> 1989</a>).</p>

<p class="para">Dumas high-temperature combustion technology has advantages for the measurement of TSN for several reasons (<a href="#ch07ref43">McGill and Figueiredo 1993</a>). For example, all forms of soil N can be included without pre-treatments; it can be adapted for <sup>15</sup>N tracer studies when linked to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer; it eliminates the need for strong-acid digestions; requires <a id="page_111"></a>little laboratory bench space, and has multi-element capability. Disadvantages include occasionally lower apparent TSN concentrations in soils with high levels of fixed NH<sub>4</sub>-N, and the reverse (due to incomplete combustion resulting in the formation of methane rather than CO<sub>2</sub>) in some organic-rich soils (<a href="#ch07ref15">Bremner 1996</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nowadays, several manufacturers produce high-temperature combustion analysers suited to the measurement of TSN across a range of concentrations (e.g. 0.02 to &#62;0.5% N). Typically, the dry, finely-ground sample is subjected to high-temperature combustion (e.g. 900&#8211;1350&#176;C) in a stream of purifed O<sub>2</sub>. An aliquot of the gases produced by combustion is carried by helium gas to a thermal conductivity cell for measurement of any N<sub>2</sub> generated, a process typically taking 3&#8211;5 min. A heated Cu catalyst reduces NO<sub>x</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>. The example methodology described is based on the automated LECO&#8482; CNS 2000 analyser.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm), air-dry (40&#176;C) soil samples are required. These are accurately weighed into ceramic boats and then combusted. Water and CO<sub>2</sub> are subsequently absorbed in an anhydrone tube, leaving the N<sub>2</sub> to be measured by thermal conductivity. Practical quantitation limits depend on the amount of sample used but are typically around 0.01&#8211;0.02% N. At all times, workplace health and safety procedures need to be in place and followed, given the use of high temperature combustion and pressurised O<sub>2</sub> gas.

<p class="para">NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for TSN relies on absorbances in the NIR spectral region from overtones and combination bands of fundamental absorbances. The relationship between these absorbances and one or more of the &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods for TSN may come from generic relationships from a spectral library or by establishing calibrations in-house, usually 1:1 continuous relationships across the soil concentration range. Coefficients of determination for validation samples of &#8805;0.85&#8211;0.9 should be achievable.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec10"></a>7B Water-soluble nitrate-N</h3>
<p class="para">One of the attractions of using water as an extractant for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in soils is that the same extract can also be used to measure soil EC (Method 3A1), soil pH (Method 4A1) and water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (Method 5). Also, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in soil is mostly water-soluble and is weakly retained or not retained by soil colloids in all but some highly weathered soils. Moreover, water is a cheap extractant for routine soil testing services. Aqueous salt solutions such as 2 M KCl are preferred as an extractant for precise studies and when soils are known to have a significant anion exchange capacity. Soil concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub>-N can range from negligible to &#62;300 mg N/kg (e.g. <a href="#ch07ref55">Rayment 1994</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Three methods for determining water-soluble nitrate-N have 7B codes. All have the same method of extraction but different analytical finishes; viz., automated colour SFA, FIA and IC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">International and local experience is that variations due to method of determination are relatively minor. Of greater importance are field sampling techniques and sample-transport conditions. This is because NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> can move with water in or on the soil, and may accumulate at different soil depths or wash from the site. In addition, care is necessary to minimise the possibility of N transformations and additions during transport to the laboratory, during sample preparation, and while air drying (&#8804;40&#8211;45&#176;C) and subsequent milling.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter07sec11"></a>7B1a Water-soluble nitrate-N &#8211; automated colour, continuous segmented flow</h3>
<p class="para">This method has relevance to soil mineral-N fertility, provided field-moist samples are kept cool (refrigerate if possible) between sampling and the commencement of air drying. Nitrates (and any NO<sub>2</sub>-N present) are obtained for analysis after filtration or centrifugation of an aliquot of the 1:5 soil/water suspension.</p>
<p class="indent-para">SFA is one of the technologies suited to the measurement of NO<sub>3</sub>-N in these extracts. One example is based on AutoAnalyzer I/II technology, although it is recognised that improvements in system performance are ongoing, as mentioned in the preamble to Method 7A2a. Specifically, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> in the extract is reduced to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> with hydrazine (or via a cadmium reduction column) and the NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentration determined by an automated colorimetric procedure (Griess-Ilosvay reaction) that absorbs strongly at 540 nm. Generally, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> is not present <a id="page_115"></a>in significant concentrations and is ignored. In special cases where NO<sub>2</sub>-N is suspected and field-moist soil is available for extraction, the analysis may be conducted without the reduction step to determine NO<sub>2</sub>-N concentration. Nitrate-N is then obtained by difference.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Reducing substances (e.g. ascorbates) and oxidising agents (e.g. hypochlorite) can interfere with the determination. An alum&#8211;NaCl solution is introduced prior to dialysis to enhance the movement of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> across the dialyser membrane (G.A. Barry and G.F. Haydon, unpublished data). The auto-analyser manifold in <a href="#ch7fig7">Figure 7.7</a> permits simultaneous determination of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in aqueous soil extracts (if required).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Continuous flow instrumentation uses a peristaltic pump to draw sample extracts from the sampler into a manifold designed to mix the samples with reagents that are being pumped at predetermined flow rates, and on eventually to the colorimeter. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions from the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the optional flow diagrams shown in <a href="#ch7fig7">Figures 7.7</a> and <a href="#ch7fig8">7.8</a>.</p>

<p class="para">Technical aspects of FIA technology are covered in earlier preambles. Specifically, water-soluble inorganic NO<sub>3</sub>-N is extracted from soils off-line, as described in 7B1a. The FIA &#8216;finish&#8217; is based on the Griess-Ilosvay reaction for NO<sub>2</sub>-N (if present) and NO<sub>3</sub>-N, the latter following automated reduction to NO<sub>2</sub>-N in a copperised-cadmium column (Cd-Cu reduction column). The NO<sub>2</sub>-N is then determined by diazotising with sulfanilamide and by coupling with N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride. The resulting water-soluble dye has a magenta colour that absorbs strongly at 520&#8211;540 nm. The FIA analytical finish is similar to that described by <a href="#ch07ref36">Knepel (2002)</a>, plus Method 6M2a of <a href="#ch07ref69a">USDA-NSSC (1996)</a> and <a href="#ch07ref70">US-EPA (2002)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch07ref24">Gal <em>et al.</em> (2004)</a> found the Cd-Cu reduction step was critical, inclusive of the way the reductor material was prepared, the chemical conditions under which reduction takes place <a id="page_118"></a>(e.g. pH and concentration of complexing agents) and poisoning of the Cd-Cu reduction surface by sample constituents. They identified the concomitant reduction of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> as a potential problem causing loss of pH control (due to <em>in-situ</em> generation of hydroxide). De-oxygenation of the carrier solution can minimise this problem, with the additional advantages of increasing the lifetime of the reductor column and significantly reducing the concentration of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in the waste stream.</p>

<p class="para">Cd-Cu reduction columns are available prepacked from FIA instrument manufacturers. If in-house preparation is preferred, proceed (Lachat, and <a href="#ch07ref70">US-EPA 2002</a>) as follows.</p>
<p class="parab">Cadmium Preparation and Copperisation</p>
<p class="parab">Place 10&#8211;20 g of coarse Cd granules in a 250 mL borosilicate beaker. Wash with 50 mL of acetone, then with de-oxygenated deionised water, then with two &#215; 50 mL portions of 1 M HCl, then rinse with de-oxygenated deionised water. Add a 100 mL portion of 2% CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O Solution to the now treated coarse Cd granules. Swirl for about 5 min, <a id="page_120"></a>then decant the liquid and repeat with a fresh 100 mL portion of the 2% CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O Solution. Continue this process until the blue aqueous Cu<sup>2+</sup> colour persists. Decant and wash with at least five portions of Ammonium Chloride Buffer to remove colloidal Cu. The &#8216;reduced&#8217; coarse Cd should be black or dark grey. The now copperised-Cd granules may be stored in a stoppered bottle under Ammonium Chloride Buffer.</p>
<p class="paraz">Packing the Copperised&#8211;Cadmium Reduction Column</p>
<p class="parab">As a precaution, wear gloves and do all Cd transfers over a tray or beaker. Also, clamp the empty Cd-Cu reduction column upright so hands are free. Unscrew one of the coloured fittings from an end of the column, and pull out and save the foam plug. The column and threads are glass so take care not to break or chip them. Fasten this fitting up higher than the open end of the column and completely fill the Cd-Cu reduction column, attached fittings, and tubing with Ammonium Chloride Buffer. Scoop up prepared Cd-Cu granules with a spatula and pour them into the top of the filled column so that they sink down to the base of the column. Continue pouring the Cd-Cu granules in while tapping the column carefully with a screwdriver handle (or similar) to dislodge any air bubbles and to prevent gaps in the Cd-Cu filling. When the Cd-Cu granules reach about 5 mm from the open end of the column, push in the foam plug and screw on the top fitting. Rinse the outside of the column with deionised water. If air remains in the column or is introduced accidentally, connect the column into the manifold, turn the pump on maximum, and tap firmly with a screwdriver handle (or similar), working up the column until all air is removed.</p>
<p class="paraz">Cd&#8211;Cu Reducing Column Insertion Procedure</p>
<p class="parab">Before inserting the column, pump all reagents into the FIA manifold then turn off the pump. On the column, disconnect the centre tubing from one of the union connectors and immediately connect to the outlet tubing of the buffer mixing coil. Next connect the open tubing on the column to the T fitting where the colour reagent is added. <em>(Do not let air enter the recharged Cd&#8211;Cu reducing column.)</em> Return the pump to its normal speed, noting that the direction of reagent flow through the Cd-Cu reducing column is not relevant.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>FIA Analysis</em></p>
<p class="para">Ensure individual components of the FIA system are connected as specified by the instrument&#8217;s manufacturer and that the Cd-Cu reducing column is inserted correctly and is working well. Fresh columns should remain effective for 500&#8211;600 samples, provided no air enters the system. An example FIA manifold is shown in <a href="#ch7fig9">Figure 7.9</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Transfer the particulate-free, aqueous extracts into tubes for FIA analysis. Same-day measurement is preferred to limit the possibility of biological change: store filtered samples at 4&#176;C only if same-day analysis is not possible. Long storage of these extracts is not recommended and aqueous extracts must not be preserved with mercuric chloride, as this degrades the Cd-Cu reducing column (<a href="#ch07ref36">Knepel 2002</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Select appropriate concentrations of Nitrate Working Standards and transfer aliquots into similar tubes as used for unknown samples, then load the FIA sampler. Refer to the operating and software reference manuals for the FIA instrument for set-up and operational instructions for this method and activate. Subsequently, the FIA baseline should be smooth and at zero absorbance. Scatter is indicative of air bubbles and irregular reagent flow. Also observe for any inappropriate back pressure in manifold tubing and correct if necessary.</p>

<p class="para">The equipment and issues relevant to the analysis of anions in aqueous extracts of soils by IC are detailed in the soil Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> chapter, particularly Methods 5A3a and 5A3b. The only sample preparation required after soil extraction is the removal of particulate matter &#62;0.20 &#956;m by filtration or centrifugation and dilution if EC levels by Method 3A1 are high.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This technology for NO<sub>3</sub>-N can also determine NO<sub>2</sub>-N in aqueous extracts of soil but the results have little value when performed on air-dry samples. Other anions measured sequentially in the same sample at the mg/L concentration range or lower include Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub>-P and SO<sub>4</sub>-S (<a href="#ch07ref50">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> 1984</a>). These analyses can be completed sequentially within 30 min or less, using a few mL of extract. As the two IC technologies (chemical suppression of eluent conductivity and single-column with electronic suppression of eluent conductivity) give very similar results, only one method code has been allocated.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Ensure components of the IC analyzer are operating within specification. Equilibrate and determine the retention time, guided by procedures outlined in Methods 5A3a or 5A3b.

Analyse the reagent water blank and the High-, Intermediate- and Low-range Calibration Solutions by injecting 2&#8211;3 mL aliquots. Prepare calibration curves for NO<sub>3</sub>-N (and all other anions of interest) by plotting peak height (usually as &#956;S/cm) or peak area &#8211; from the chromatogram &#8211; against the concentrations of the anion calibration solutions. Note that a single standard calibration is possible if linearity can be established for a known detector setting. In such cases, determine the calibration factor F from peak height or area and the retention time. A calibration curve is preferred, however, when the relationship is non-linear (<a href="#ch07ref06">APHA 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next inject a known volume of the filtered soil/water extract (same volume as used for the calibration solution/s). Record the ion chromatogram, evaluate peak height or peak area as required for comparison with the relevant calibration curve, and determine the anion concentration (NO<sub>3</sub>-N in this case), initially as mg/L. Multiply by 5 to convert to mg/kg air-dry soil. (Another sample can be injected after the last peak (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>) has appeared and the conductivity signal has returned to base line.) To avoid interference when NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> or other anions are present at elevated concentrations, causing overlap of neighbouring anion species, minimise by sample dilution with Reagent Water, and adjust for the dilution in the final calculation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When the calibration is known to be linear, the following equation can be used to calculate the anion concentration:</p>

<p class="para">Mineralisable soil N resulting from anaerobic incubation is determined under laboratory conditions as the difference between the NH<sub>4</sub>-N measured in two separate soil extracts using 2 M KCl. The first is extracted immediately and the second after a seven-day anaerobic incubation at 40&#176;C with the soil covered by water. The seven-day incubation is carried out in sealed containers that have minimal headspace. After incubation, 2.5 M KCl extracting solution is added (extractant now &#8776;2 M KCl) and mixed prior to analysis. The initial (day zero) extraction is the same as that carried out for mineral-N, based on 2 M KCl extraction (Method 7C2a). It follows that if an estimate of NO<sub>3</sub>-N is also required, it can be obtained, along with NH<sub>4</sub>-N, from the day zero extract.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method described is adapted from <a href="#ch07ref31">Keeney (1982)</a> and B Daly (pers. comm.). It provides an index of net anaerobic potentially mineralisable N (PMN<sub>An</sub>), rather than a measure of true field mineralisation.</p>
