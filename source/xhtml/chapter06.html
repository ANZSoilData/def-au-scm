<h2 class="h2a">Carbon</h2>
<p class="para">Carbon (C) occurs in soils in many forms. These include carbonate minerals (mostly calcite and dolomite), HCO<sub>3</sub> &#175; (<a href="#ch06ref55">Pratt 1966</a>), elemental C (e.g. charcoal; &#8776;60&#8211;98% C), OM from plant and animal residues, and as CO<sub>2</sub>, which can be both free and dissolved in the soil solution. Organic C, includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, waxes, residues of micro-organisms, and complex molecules termed humic substances (<a href="#ch06ref77">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The important contribution of SOC to the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils, including soil CEC, is well documented (<a href="#ch06ref52">Parfitt 1980</a>; <a href="#ch06ref71">Stevenson 1986</a>). It is also known that soil degradation problems caused by exploitative farming practices are often accompanied by declines in SOC (<a href="#ch06ref16">Chan <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). Soil properties and how these are modified by land use are influenced by the nature and degree of decomposition of the OM &#8216;pool&#8217;. Complex OC, which involves associations between OC and soil clay particles, affects water retention and soil bulk density in predictable ways (<a href="#ch06ref22">Dexter <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">More labile (reactive) and water-soluble forms of SOC influence soil acidity, nutrient availability, the toxicity and transport of metals (<a href="#ch06ref75">Thurman 1985</a>), and the BOD of adjacent water bodies, following land runoff as the transport pathway (<a href="#ch06ref56">Rayment 2003</a>). SOC features at lower taxonomic levels in Soil Taxonomy, such as in ustollic and fluventic sub-groups (<a href="#ch06ref68">Soil Survey Staff 1975</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soils account for around two-thirds of the OC of terrestrial ecosystems in active exchange with the atmosphere. Much of this SOC has a residence time of around 1200 y (<a href="#ch06ref54">Post <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>). Typically, soil C density increases in undisturbed ecosystems with decreasing temperature for any level of rainfall, albeit SOC density is usually enhanced in humid regions relative to arid areas exposed to the same level of soil weathering. In practice, OC levels are commonly highest in surface horizons, as this is where most biological activity occurs in fertile, well-drained soils (<a href="#ch06ref19">Dalal and Chan 2001</a>). Insects such as ants and termites, birds and animals, which dig into and dwell in soil, also relocate OM at points of activity (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref35">Lobry de Bruyn and Conacher 1990</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The amounts of soil C vary from almost zero in silica sand to &#8805;60% in peaty soils that contain accumulations of partially decayed vegetative material and few soil mineral constituents. Peaty soils develop in places where poor drainage and/or sustained low temperatures inhibit the decomposition of plant residues by micro-organisms. In contrast, SOM quite quickly breaks down in warm to hot, moist, fertile, aerated soils of the subtropics and tropics.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Laboratory estimates of SOC contents are restricted to the quantity and condition of organic materials that accompany soil particles through a 2 mm sieve (<a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers 1996</a>), after the removal of obvious plant debris. Finer grinding is commonly recommended prior to analysis to improve soil homogeneity and to lessen the effects of using a small sample size. Aside from mineral-bound forms of C contained in carbonates and the like, most analytical methods on prepared samples focus on total and (less commonly) labile forms of OC. In the case of &#8216;totals&#8217;, conversion factors are often used to estimate total SOM from measured SOC concentrations. Conversion factors range from 1.72 to 2.2 (<a href="#ch06ref04">Baldock and Skjemstad 1999</a>; <a href="#ch06ref22">Dexter <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>; <a href="#ch06ref02">Aust. Std. 4419, 2003)</a>, with the factor 1.724 suggested for use as follows but only when site-specific information is unavailable (<a href="#ch06ref67">Sleutel <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>); i.e.:</p>

<p class="center-para">SOM = [SOC (same units for both) &#215; 1.724]</p>
<p class="indent-para">As reported by <a href="#ch06ref14">Bruce and Rayment (1982)</a>, <a href="#ch06ref69">Spain <em>et al.</em> (1983)</a> and others, the OC contents of Australian soils of different types and locations are mostly &#60;5% C. Desert loams and earthy sands typically contain &#60;0.1% C, whereas humus-rich soils from alpine regions can contain from 7&#8211;14% C (<a href="#ch06ref04">Baldock and Skjemstad 1999</a>). <a href="#ch06ref79">Vortman (1980)</a> reported SOC concentrations in surface horizons of 11 New Zealand reference soils of 1.2&#8211;9.5% C (wet oxidation method), with a median of 4.3% C, whereas median concentrations at around 50 and 100 cm in the same soils were mostly much lower (0.8 and 0.2% C, respectively). Ratings for total SOC applicable to soil and land use surveys from New Zealand and north-eastern Australia are provided in <a href="#ch6tab1">Table 6.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The many different forms and concentrations of soil C challenge the analyst. Also at issue is whether the concentration and forms of soil C, including total and labile forms, need to be known accurately or only approximately. Methods are included that address these different requirements.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Specifically, methods for the determination of SOC have evolved from separate chemical reactions and from reaction kinetics. One, attributed to Walkley and Black (W&#38;B: <a href="#ch06ref81">Walkley and Black 1934</a>; <a href="#ch06ref80">Walkley 1947</a>), involves wet oxidation by a dichromate-sulfuric acid (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> &#8211; H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) mixture.</p>
<p class="indent-para">With wet oxidation (<a href="#ch06ref80">Walkley 1947</a>), SOM acts to reduce Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> at elevated temperature. Recoveries of SOC are usually incomplete when there is total reliance on heat of reaction (Method 6A1). Typical recoveries are around 75&#8211;90% for surface soils, and vary with soil type and depth. Therefore, C concentrations are reported as OC<sub>W&#38;B</sub>, without any attempt to convert to total OC by a multiplication factor. When estimates of total SOC by wet oxidation are preferred, the method of <a href="#ch06ref25">Heanes (1984)</a> is available (Method 6B1). It incorporates an external heating step to encourage complete oxidation of SOC. Both wet oxidation methods require correction for positive interference from Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in saline soils, while the presence of solid-phase carbonates can lower the expected heat of reaction by &#8216;consuming&#8217; some of the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> reagent. Across 72 test samples used in soil inter-laboratory proficiency programs of ASPAC from 1997 to 2007 (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref53">Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch06ref59">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>), grand median results by catalysed, high temperature combustion relative to corresponding OC<sub>W&#38;B</sub> results were 1.08:1 across a concentration range of 0.12&#8211;6.4% C.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_67"></a>Three methods included are based on the release of CO<sub>2</sub> following high-temperature combustion of small quantities of sample. These catalysed methods for SOC (Dumas C) measure total soil C, including charcoal and carbonates/bicarbonates (unless these are absent or removed prior to analysis). The technology mostly utilises microprocessor-controlled equipment (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref42">Merry and Spouncer 1988</a>). Such equipment has proven robust and reliable, although results can vary slightly between instruments (<a href="#ch06ref67">Sleutel <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>), likely to be due to the temperature of combustion. More details are given in preambles to Method 6B2 (6B2a, 6B2b) and to Method 6B3.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Total SOC can also be predicted by correlations between both NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy or MIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and conventionally measured total SOC values (<a href="#ch06ref30">Janik <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>; <a href="#ch06ref45">Meyer 1998</a>; <a href="#ch06ref37">Malley <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#ch06ref84">Zimmermann <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). These non-destructive methods are coded as 6B4a and 6B4b, respectively. They create no adverse environmental wastes but accuracy depends on the quality of conventionally measured total SOC values and the mathematical algorithm/s used for the correlations. As soil carbonate minerals may interfere with infrared spectra, relationships tend to be strongest when carbonates have been removed by pre-treatment and when applied to neutral and acidic soils containing no carbonates. Obviously, chemical pre-treatment (if preferred to separately estimating and adjusting for carbonate) will remove some of the original soil mass, which must be taken into account. Also, the soil must be redried following chemical pre-treatment.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Also described are methods for more labile forms of SOC (Methods 6C1, 6D1, and 6E1).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Method 6C1 quantifies POM by using physical separation based on particle size. POM is quite reactive, and is the form of OC easily lost as a consequence of cultivation (<a href="#ch06ref15">Cambardella and Elliott 1992</a>). Accordingly, knowledge of POM concentrations in soils (reported as % C) can help improve understanding of the role POM plays in the turnover of SOM, a process that helps in the cycling of essential plant nutrients.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Method 6D1 determines the fraction of soil C extractable by the pyrophosphate reagent described in Method 13B1. <a href="#ch06ref11">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1987)</a> consider this method to be relevant to the identification of spodic horizons in Soil Taxonomy, when pyrophosphate-extractable Fe values are &#60;0.1%. (The spodic horizon &#8211; from Gr. spodos, wood ash &#8211; is a dark-coloured subsurface horizon that contains illuvial amorphous substances composed of OM and Al, with or without Fe.) The pyrophosphate solution extracts low molecular weight OM associated with Fe and Al in organic complexes and in short-order minerals such as ferrihydrite.</p>
<p class="indent-para">With growing interest in indicators of soil health, easily-reactive forms of SOC have attracted attention, particularly those based on permanganate-oxidisable OC (<a href="#ch06ref10">Blair <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>). This is because the quantities of OC oxidised by dilute solutions of potassium permanganate (e.g. 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>) correlate with many important soil properties (<a href="#ch06ref49">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). Method 6E1 derives from <a href="#ch06ref83">Weil <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> and <a href="#ch06ref47">Moody and Cong (2008)</a> and is suited to laboratory and field use. It uses brief (2 min) soil contact with aqueous 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>, followed by 5 min standing in the presence of aqueous 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the latter added to flocculate soil particles. The method also responds to the presence of WSOC, such as sucrose lost via cane juice during mechanical harvesting of sugarcane or contained in recycled filter mud from sugarmills (<a href="#ch06ref57">Rayment and Bohl 2002</a>). <a href="#ch06ref82">Wang <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> reported 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> - leachate concentrations of soluble OM from five Australian soils of 127&#8211;133 mg C/kg.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The presence of charcoal in soils confounds interpretation of SOC. Even OC<sub>w&#38;B</sub> (Method 6A1), which uses heat of reaction to oxidise OC, may not discriminate between finely dispersed charcoal and SOC. The finer the charcoal particles, the greater the chances that at least some will be oxidised. Accordingly, traditional methods for OC, which include Methods 6A1 to 6B3, can slightly overestimate OM that might be available for microbiological decomposition. Methods for charcoal-C have been described by <a href="#ch06ref66">Skjemstad <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a>, using ultraviolet photo-oxidation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and by <a href="#ch06ref24">Glaser <em>et al.</em> (1998)</a>, using benzenepolycarboxylic acids as markers for charcoal-C during HNO<sub>3</sub> digestions. These methods are not described herein, as they are analytically time-consuming and expensive. Instead, a method is described (Method 6F1) that uses peroxide and dilute HNO<sub>3</sub>, with heating to oxidise OC and to quantitatively allow charcoal-C to be determined by dry combustion.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 6.1.</strong> Soil OC concentrations vs % robust CVs, derived from ASPAC soil inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The final method (6G1) provides a useful estimate of SOM, based on loss-on-ignition. It requires only relatively simple laboratory equipment (precision balance; oven; desiccator) and depends on the knowledge that ignition of soils at 500&#8211;550&#176;C for 2 h removes almost all OM with little dehydroxylation of clay minerals (<a href="#ch06ref26">Heiri <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). If operated sequentially, the same soil sample and tared container can be used to measure the moisture held between air drying (40&#176;C) and oven drying (105&#176;C), including most water of crystallisation; a rough estimate of SOM, plus an estimate of soil carbonate content, obtained from the loss of weight across the temperature range 550&#8211;950&#176;C. Based on unpublished data of B. Daly, the upper temperature range may be insufficient to completely remove shell carbonates from all New Zealand soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The methods described in this chapter, what they measure, and an indication of the accuracy or reliability of the measurements, are summarised in <a href="#ch6tab2">Table 6.2</a> and discussed further in preambles to each method. <a href="#ch6fig1">Figure 6.1</a> shows how robust co-efficients of variation varied continuously with SOC concentrations by two methods, when homogenous soils of &#60;0.5 mm were analysed. The data were sourced from laboratories across Australasia that participated in ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007, including those reported by <a href="#ch06ref53">Peverill and Johnstone (1997)</a> and <a href="#ch06ref59">Rayment <em>et al.</em> (2007)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Irrespective of method, analytical cleanliness is essential, because dust, dirt and fumes containing elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations can lead to positive errors (<a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers 1996</a>), particularly at low soil C concentrations. Similarly, all soil sampling and grinding equipment should be free of oil and corrosion inhibitors, as these substances can transfer to the sample, adding to the apparent soil C content. Fine grinding of &#60;2 mm soil samples to &#8804;0.5 mm helps increase repeatability by decreasing soil heterogeneity (<a href="#ch06ref25">Heanes 1984</a>), and can elevate apparent results slightly (<a href="#ch06ref42">Merry and Spouncer 1988</a>).</p>

<p class="indent-para">In the absence of interferences, the chromic ions (Cr<sup>3+</sup>) produced should be in reasonable proportion to the OC oxidised. In aqueous acidic solution, Cr<sup>3+</sup> has absorption maxima at 450 nm and 600 nm. Since Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> does not absorb at 600 nm, the absorbance at this wavelength can be used to estimate Cr<sup>3+</sup> and hence OC (<a href="#ch06ref61">Sims and Haby 1971</a>; <a href="#ch06ref44">Metson <em>et al.</em> 1979</a>). An advantage over the original titrimetric procedure and the colorimetric estimation of unreacted Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> solution is that accurate standardisation of the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> solution is not required.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Since Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> reacts to form chromyl chloride (CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), correction for positive Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> interference in saline soils (&#62;0.5% Cl) is recommended. Ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) may also produce high results but this possibility is usually ignored (PASS would be an exception) as air-dry soils do not normally contain significant reactive Fe<sup>2+</sup> (<a href="#ch06ref01">Anon 1983</a>). Elemental C (e.g. coal and charcoal) is usually little attacked by this method (except if present as very fine particles), while carbonates, even when present at high concentration (e.g. 50%) have inconsequential impacts.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Note that the sodium dichromate (Na<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) or chromium trioxide (CrO<sub>3</sub>) used in the procedure are powerful oxidising agents and systemic poisons. Accordingly, avoid external and internal contact and keep these chemicals away from combustible materials due to risk of fire. These are preferred to potassium dichromate (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), simply for reasons of cost (<a href="#ch06ref44">Metson <em>et al.</em> 1979</a>).</p>

Transfer soils to dry 250 mL conical beakers (all should be of similar manufacture and dimensions and located equidistance apart).

<p class="para">Catalysed, high temperature combustion methods (Dumas C) estimate total soil C when charcoal and carbonates/bicarbonates are present in the samples presented for analysis. TOC is applicable only when these &#8216;interferences&#8217; are absent or removed prior to analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Procedures are provided that employ high temperature combustion of around 1050&#8211;1200&#176;C but with different means of measuring the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> liberated. The first, now largely superseded by superior technology, involves volumetric measurement of the liberated gases (Method 6B2a). Method 6B2b uses contemporary technology, albeit different instrument manufacturers may vary catalysts, furnace temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing technologies to optimise measurement performance. Method 6B3 is similar to Method 6B2b, except it incorporates a chemical pre-treatment step to remove positive interferences from carbonates/bicarbonates plus the earlier physical removal of visible charcoal and similar sources of elemental C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">From a workplace health and safety perspective, laboratories that employ O<sub>2</sub>-enriched, high temperature combustion methods must take precautions to prevent burns and fires, and also while handling compressed gases.

<p class="para">This method from <a href="#ch06ref58">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, originally coded as 6B2, involves production, purification and measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> evolved when soil C is ignited in a stream of O<sub>2</sub>. It only provides an accurate result for TOC in soil samples with no carbonate minerals and no charcoal (and similar materials containing elemental C). In their presence, the result equates to total soil C.</p>

The purified CO<sub>2</sub> is determined by a volumetric procedure.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Because all C compounds are converted to CO<sub>2</sub>, C from carbonates, charcoal, undecomposed wood, etc, will be included in the result, unless absent or removed in advance, noting that unglazed sample &#8216;boats&#8217; are not suitable for pretreatment with acid to remove carbonates. Therefore, soils containing carbonates/bicarbonates should be analysed by Method 6B3, or the apparent results corrected for the percentage of carbonate/bicarbonate determined by separate analysis (Method 19A1 or 19B1). Corrective actions (if any) for the minimisation of interferences should be noted when reporting results.</p>
<p class="indent-para">CO<sub>2</sub> is measured volumetrically, which nowadays is superseded technology. The resultant gases (CO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>) are passed into a calibrated burette in which 5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is displaced.

<p class="para">Initially remove any charcoal, wood, coal or the like, prior to commencement of soil grinding operations. Also perform a spot-test for the presence of significant carbonate. To do this, place a portion of a finely-ground sub-sample (&#60;0.5 mm) on a &#8216;spot plate&#8217;, moisten with a few drops of Reagent Water, then add 4 M HCl drop-wise to the wetted sample, and inspect for the presence of any effervescence, allowing up to at least 5 min for reaction with dolomite to occur. If there is no visible reaction and no reason to otherwise suspect the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate, then proceed to determine SOC by Method 6B2b.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When carbonate-C is confirmed and accurate measurement of TOC is essential, &#8216;condition&#8217; a series of non-porous combustion &#8216;boats&#8217; by igniting them to remove all traces of carbonate (and other forms of C), cool, number and tare. Also take a known weight of the finely-ground sub-sample (&#60;0.5 mm), based on the capacity of the combustion analyser and of the vessel used in the combustion analyser (be guided by the final sample-weight requirements of Method 6B2b). Treat each sample separately (and quantitatively) with an excess of 5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> solution on a hot plate in a fume cabinet free of C contamination.

<p class="para">Infrared (IR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is an emerging technology that relies on statistical relationships between IR soil spectra and results obtained from &#8216;conventional&#8217; measurements, in this case for TOC. The technique has also been used to quantify SOC fractions (<a href="#ch06ref17">Cozzolino and Mor&#243;n 2006</a>; <a href="#ch06ref84">Zimmermann <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">This non-destructive analytical option for soil C follows developments in spectrometer hardware covering near infrared reflectance (NIR: e.g. 750&#8211;2500 nm) and mid infrared reflectance (MIR: e.g. 2500&#8211;25 000 nm) in conjunction with smart statistical software. Fundamental is the knowledge that different IR absorption bands exist that can be assigned to spectral overtones and combinations of the fundamental vibrations (<a href="#ch06ref06">Beech <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>) associated with chemical bonding of C, H and O, etc., such as C=C, C-H, C-O, C=O, OH, COOH, etc. (e.g. see Table 35-3 of <a href="#ch06ref73">Swift 1996</a>). Relative peak intensities, commonly but not exclusively assessed using partial least square regressions, help to achieve quantitative analysis (<a href="#ch06ref70">Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Laboratory methods for TOC using both NIR (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref20">Dalal and Henry 1986</a>; <a href="#ch06ref60">Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#ch06ref70">Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>) and MIR (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref31">Janik and Skjemstad 1995</a>; <a href="#ch06ref30">Janik <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>; <a href="#ch06ref46">McBratney <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>) spectra are provided in Methods 6B4a and 6B4b, respectively. Each laboratory must confirm that strong, robust relationships exist between outputs from their specific IR analyser/s and conventional measurements of SOC. Regional or national calibration datasets may become available, derived by &#8216;fingerprinting&#8217; modal examples from &#8216;legacy&#8217; and new soil collections (<a href="#ch06ref78">Viscarra Rossel <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>). Moreover, if the conventional measurements were expressed on an oven-dry basis, then the IR results for TOC will also apply to oven-dry soils. Sequential scans typically take &#8776;1&#8211;2 min/sample. Unless predetermined otherwise by the calibration dataset, the soil samples should be &#8776;40&#176;C air-dry and finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm) at the time of scanning. <a href="#ch6fig3">Figure 6.3</a> shows the small amount of laboratory bench-space required for IR instrumentation.</p>

<p class="para">According to <a href="#ch06ref03">Baldock (2008)</a>, four biologically significant types or fractions of SOC exist, viz.:</p>
<ul class="bullet1">
<li>crop residues &#8211; shoot and root residues &#60;2 mm found in soil and on top of the soil;</li>
<li>POC &#8211; defined as individual pieces of plant debris that are &#60;2 mm but &#62;0.053 mm;</li>
<li>humus or decomposed materials &#60;0.053 mm, dominated by molecules adhering to soil minerals and colloids, and</li>
<li>recalcitrant OC that is biologically stable and typically in the form of charcoal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-para">The four fractions described are composed of different materials with different chemical and physical properties and different decomposition rates. Moreover, the amount of each fraction is highly dependent on management practices; for example, the tillage practices employed. Although crop residues usually break down quickly, the method described herein for POC will include some crop residues as defined by <a href="#ch06ref03">Baldock (2008)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Key functions of POC include improving soil structure and the cycling of soil nutrients. <a href="#ch06ref62">Six <em>et al.</em> (2000)</a> claim POC improves soil aggregation since it can form an organic pore surrounded by clay, silt particles and aggregates. According to <a href="#ch06ref66">Skjemstad <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a>, most charcoal-C is retained in the &#60;53 &#956;m fraction but some larger charcoal particles can be retained with the POC fraction. Therefore, sample inspection under a microscope is recommended before analysis for charcoal-C using, for example, the nuclear magnetic resonance approach of <a href="#ch06ref66">Skjemstad <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a>. Charcoal in the POC fraction can then be removed as had been done earlier by other workers (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref72">Swain 1973</a>; <a href="#ch06ref76">Tolonen 1986</a>) who both sorted charcoal particles by hand or under a microscope in estimating the soil content of charcoal-C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The extraction component of this method follows that used by <a href="#ch06ref15">Cambardella and Elliott (1992)</a>. Finely ground, air-dry soil is mechanically dispersed overnight in aqueous sodium hexametaphosphate, with subsequent filtering through a 53 &#956;m sieve. The material retained on the sieve is then dried and homogenised using a mortar and pestle before dry combustion (Dumas) for organic C, an approach used by <a href="#ch06ref13">Bouajila and Gallali (2008)</a>. Carbonate particles, if present, cause positive interference and should be removed physically or accounted for by separate analysis by Method 19A or 19B.</p>

<p class="para">This method guided by <a href="#ch06ref47">Moody and Cong (2008)</a> uses 0.033 M KMnO<sub>4</sub>. It targets labile or active SOC, including any WSOC that might be present. Results typically correlate with several key soil properties: aggregate stability (<a href="#ch06ref08">Blair <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>, <a href="#ch06ref09">1996</a>; <a href="#ch06ref07">Bell <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>); ECEC and pH buffer capacity (<a href="#ch06ref49">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>); and microbial biomass-C (<a href="#ch06ref48">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). Across a range of soils, PPOC is generally well correlated with TOC (e.g. <a href="#ch06ref49">Moody <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). At least portion of the measured PPOC, however, can sometimes be the result of short-term land management practices that add highly labile WSOC to the &#8216;system&#8217; (sucrose is an example). Elevated BOD in adjacent natural waters can result if this WSOC leaves the site in runoff (<a href="#ch06ref56">Rayment 2003</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter06sec13"></a>6F1 Charcoal-C</h3>
<p class="para">Many soils contain charcoal, resulting from thousands of years of burning of C-rich materials, combined with a turnover time measured in centuries or millennia (<a href="#ch06ref63">Skjemstad 2001</a>). Charcoal generated by fires can constitute up to 0.8% C in soil and may represent up to 30% of the SOC content of Australian soils (<a href="#ch06ref64">Skjemstad <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>). Charcoal is not used by micro-organisms and therefore does not contribute to soil biological activity. It follows that as POC and other reactive forms of C decline with periods of cultivation, the more stable charcoal fraction increases as a portion of total soil C. Accordingly, as soil fertililty levels decline, the need to account for charcoal is becoming more important, as most contemporary methods for total SOC cannot discriminate between charcoal-C and other SOC forms. <a href="#ch06ref40">McBeth <em>et al.</em> (undated)</a> <a id="page_85"></a>reported that charcoal-C in the 0&#8211;2 cm topsoil layer was higher at sites where vegetation had been burnt relative to adjacent non-burnt areas.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Analytical methods for charcoal-C have been described by <a href="#ch06ref24">Glaser <em>et al.</em> (1998)</a> and by <a href="#ch06ref66">Skjemstad <em>et al.</em> (2002)</a> but these methods are complex and time-consuming. MIR offers potential for determining soil C fractions (<a href="#ch06ref41">Merry and Janik 2001</a>; <a href="#ch06ref32">Janik <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>) but successful analysis by MIR of charcoal-C across multiple laboratories has still to be demonstrated. Therefore, the chemical method described involves gentle, relatively lengthy digestion of soil with a combination of concentrated hydrogen peroxide and dilute nitric acid, the subsequent recovery of charcoal residues, followed by quantitative determination of charcoal-C in the residue using Dumas combustion as the analytical finish (<a href="#ch06ref34">Kurth <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>). The method was able to recover (see Note 1) &#62;92% of the charcoal added (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) and effectively consume most of the other forms of SOC. As recovery estimates were high at low concentrations (&#60;0.1% charcoal-C), the authors suggested a correction multiplier of 0.70 to account for this over-estimation. Based on reported data, the method described is expected to be reasonably quantitative over the working range 0.1&#8211;5% charcoal-C (dry wt).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>30% Hydrogen Peroxide</em></p>
<p class="para">Use 30% technical or analytical grade hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Handle and store this reagent with caution, as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is hazardous. Users should wear PVC gloves and safety glasses when using the chemical. Operations involving H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> should be carried out only where there is excellent ventilation.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>1.0 M Nitric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">Dilute 66.7 mL of nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub>, 15 M (1.4 g/mL) to 1.0 L using deionised water.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1.00 g of air-dry soil into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, add 20 mL of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 10 mL of 1 M HNO<sub>3</sub>. Swirl the flask at room temperature for 30 min. before heating to 100&#176;C and maintaining that temperature for 16 h. Swirl samples occasionally and observe for any continued effervescence. If the chemical reaction in the flask is still active, heating for an additional 4 h is recommended.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When digestion is complete, filter sample through Whatman No. 2 filter paper, before drying the retained material at 50&#176;C overnight. Homogenise the residue quantitatively with a mortar and pestle if required. Determine TOC in the dried material using the analytical finish described in 6B1 or 6B3. Total C measured by Dumas combustion is reported as charcoal-C, following the assumption that all non-charcoal-C has been consumed in the digestion process. When calculating the result from the combustion furnace (or equivalent), take account of the initial sample weight and the weight of dry residue. Also, for apparent charcoal-C values of &#60;0.1%, apply a correction multiplier of 0.70, or as independently obtained by the testing laboratory.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report charcoal-C (% C) on an oven-dry basis. Use the air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratio to make the oven-dry conversion. Refer to Method 2A1 for guidance with regard to this soil moisture calculation.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Note</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Recovery estimates reported by <a href="#ch06ref34">Kurth <em>et al.</em> (2006)</a> were made by combining known amounts of soil and charcoal to give 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0% charcoal-C (w/w). Soil and charcoal were mixed by grinding the amended soil to a very fine powder.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_86"></a><a id="chapter06sec14"></a>6G1 Total organic matter, organic C, and carbonate by loss-on-ignition</h3>
<p class="para">Loss-on-ignition (LOI) is a credible option when clients require approximate results for SOC and/or SOM (<a href="#ch06ref21">Davies 1974</a>). The same applies to estimates of soil carbonate.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The methodology is particularly suited to laboratories with a restricted suite of equipment and/or because the test avoids the problem of safe disposal of dichromate-sulfuric acid solutions (<a href="#ch06ref18">Craft <em>et al.</em> 1991</a>). The technology is well-established in laboratories that work with composts and manures, where LOI is used to determine ash content and by reciprocation, the OM content of these materials (<a href="#ch06ref39">Matthiessen <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). Because the method is relatively safe and inexpensive, it is widely used for diagnostic soil testing in the USA (<a href="http://www.agviselabs.com/tech_art/om.php">http://www.agviselabs.com/tech_art/om.php</a>). With few exceptions, elemental C contained in coal or charcoal or other carbonised material is also destroyed at ignition temperatures between 375&#8211;850&#176;C (<a href="#ch06ref05">Ball 1964</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The procedure involves the ignition of soils at high temperatures, thereby combusting the OM which is lost, along with any volatile solids that may also exist. There is no universal agreement, however, on the time and temperature of ignition. For example, <a href="#ch06ref51">Nelson and Sommers (1996)</a> recommend ignition at 400&#176;C for 16 h, whereas the preferred combination for composting materials is 550&#176;C for 2 h (<a href="#ch06ref39">Matthiessen <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). In the method described, the temperature (500&#8211;550&#176;C) and time (2 h) for LOI to determine OM content derives from <a href="#ch06ref26">Heiri <em>et al.</em> (2001)</a>. Other steps in the procedure allow the calculation of soil moisture content at 40&#176;C and later, an estimate of soil carbonate content following further heating to 950&#176;C.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method described does not account for the presence of any water of crystalisation that may still exist in some hydrated soil minerals across the temperature range 105&#8211;180&#176;C.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Apparatus</em></h3>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Borosilicate beakers or silica or porcelain crucibles (&#8776;20 mL capacity)</li>
<li>Laboratory drying oven set at 105&#176;C &#177; 2.5&#176;C</li>
<li>Muffle furnace set at 550&#176;C (range 500&#8211;550&#176;C)</li>
<li>Muffle furnace set at 950&#176;C &#177; 10&#176;C</li>
<li>Analytical balance capable of weighing &#177;0.01 mg</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Initially &#8216;condition&#8217; the numbered 20 mL beakers or crucibles at 550&#176;C for around 2 h, cool and determine the tare weight of each to 0.10 mg.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next add to each tared container a known weight (1&#8211;3 g of air-dry soil of &#60;0.5 mm maximum particle size; Weight<sub>40C</sub>) and heat in the laboratory drying oven at 105&#176;C for 24 h. Cool in a desiccator over fresh anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub> then determine weight of container + dry soil and subsequently the weight (g) of the oven-dry (105&#176;C) soil by subtraction (Weight<sub>105C</sub>). Now, place the containers with the dry soils in the pre-heated (500&#8211;550&#176;C) muffle furnace and continue the drying process. After 2 h, remove the containers + remaining soil from the muffle furnace, transfer containers carefully to the desiccator containing fresh anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub> to cool, then weigh as earlier described and obtain the weight of soil by subtraction (Weight<sub>550C</sub>). If an estimate of soil carbonate content is also required, continue the process by placing the 550&#176;C dried containers and samples in the muffle furnace set at 950&#176;C for 2 h to evolve all the CO<sub>2</sub> from any carbonate minerals. Remove the containers + remaining soil from the muffle furnace, cool in the desiccator containing fresh anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub>, then weigh as earlier described and obtain the weight of soil by subtraction (Weight<sub>950C</sub>).</p>
