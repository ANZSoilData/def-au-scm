<h2 class="h2a">Soil pH</h2>
<p class="para">The pH value of soil is a numerical expression of the intensity of acidity (or alkalinity) that in turn influences soil conditions and plant growth. The effects include changes in the solubility and activity of various biologically important elements and processes.</p>
<p class="indent-para">As with most measurements on soil, pH values vary with the procedure used. For example, pH is affected by the soil/solution ratio and by the composition and temperature of the equilibrating solution. In general, pH values increase as the ratio of soil/solution widens. Also, pH values of most soils are lower when determined in a salt solution rather than at the same soil/solution ratio in 1:5 soil/water (pH<sub>w</sub>). Differences are commonly in the vicinity of 0.5 to 1.0 pH unit but inter-relationships vary with soil type and often are polynomial (<a href="#ch04ref02">Aitken and Moody 1991</a>; <a href="#ch04ref19">Little 1992</a>) rather than linear (<a href="#ch04ref11">Conyers and Davey 1988</a>; <a href="#ch04ref10">Bruce <em>et al.</em> 1989</a>). In highly weathered soils, the differences between pH values measured in salt solutions and in water extracts can be insignificant or even reversed. Ultimately, the laboratory measurement of soil pH, irrespective of the procedure, reflects the average of a range of effects at microscopic scale, including soil ionic strength, soil composition and biological activity.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For large numbers of Queensland surface soils, pH in a 1:5 soil/water extract of &#8776;5.0&#8211;5.4 is equivalent to pH in a 1:5 soil/0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> extract of &#8776;4.6. At pH 4.0 for a 1:5 soil/water extract, the corresponding pH of a 1:5 soil/0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> extract is &#8776;3.5 (<a href="#ch04ref01">Ahern <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>), although there are many exceptions, particularly in highly weathered and organic soils with variable surface charge characteristics.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The addition of soluble fertilisers to non-saline soils may result in an apparent lowering of soil pH when measured in water extracts but the presence of soluble fertilisers usually has little effect on the apparent pH, when measured in a salt solution such as 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. These effects are observed without any addition of H<sup>+</sup> to the system. Preferred pH<sub>w</sub> levels in surface soils (0-10 cm) range from 6.0&#8211;8.0, although good growth of many plant species is possible over a wide range of pH values, in the absence of nutrient deficiencies or toxicities. Ratings for soil pH values are given in <a href="#ch4tab1">Table 4.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent-para1">Generally, pH<sub>w</sub> values &#8804;4 are indicative of sulfides (<a href="#ch04ref16">Isbell 1998</a>, <a href="#ch04ref26">Thomas 1967</a>; <a href="chapter20.html#chapter20">Chapter 20</a>, this volume), while levels ranging from around 8.5&#8211;9.5 are indicative of significant quantities of exchangeable Na (<a href="#ch04ref26">Thomas 1967</a>). Soils or sediments with pH values &#62;10 suggest the presence of free OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>, probably associated with the industrial use of caustic soda (NaOH).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nutrient availability tends to optimise in the pH range 6&#8211;7, while soils that are strongly to very strongly acidic typically enhance the solubilities of Al, Fe and B, and restrict the solubility of plant available Mo. At elevated pH levels (moderately to very strongly alkaline), the plant availability of nutrients such as P, B, Zn, Mn, Fe and possibly Cu may be restricted. In contrast, Mo availability is enhanced.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Measurement of pH traditionally involves detection of the change in potential of a glass-calomel electrode array (separate electrodes or in combination), nowadays using a pH or millivolt meter, standardised against buffer solutions of known pH. As values for these buffers vary with temperature (<a href="#ch04ref06">Bates 1962</a>; <a href="#ch04ref04">Alvarez 1984</a>), it is recommended that automated temperature compensation be activated, if included as a feature of the pH meter. Soil pH can also be &#8216;predicted&#8217; by a surrogate relationship established between MIR and conventional pH measurements of relevant soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Theoretically, pH is the negative logarithm of the H<sup>+</sup> activity [H<sup>+</sup>], as shown in Equation 4.1.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0034-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">It follows that the pH scale is logarithmic, indicating a unit change in pH is equivalent to a ten-fold increase or decrease in the activity of H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>. The relationship between the <a id="page_35"></a>activities of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&#8211;</sup> is based on the disassociation constant of pure water (K<sub>w</sub>; Equation 4.2), with examples provided in <a href="#ch4tab2">Table 4.2</a>. In routine measurements of soil pH, it is standard practice to ignore effects on H<sup>+</sup> activities due to varying ionic species and solution ionic strengths.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f0035-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">When there is a need to calculate the average or median pH value (or the like) from a collection of results, the measured pH values should first be converted into &#8211;log [H<sup>+</sup>] before applying the relevant mathematics. That answer must then be transformed back to pH units (antilog). For example, the average (&#177; std.dev.) of pH values 4.0, 4.5, 5.5, 7.0, 8.3 and 8.8 might appear to be 6.35 &#177; 1.99 but is actually 4.65 &#177; 4.40. This approach should be applied to results from all pH methods.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Preambles to individual pH methods in this chapter (see <a href="#ch4tab3">Table 4.3</a> for summary details) provide brief details of the chemistries involved. The increasing use of automated pH &#8216;robots&#8217; (<a href="#ch04ref15">Grigg <em>et al.</em> 1980</a>; see <a href="#ch4fig1">Figure 4.1</a> for an example) is recognised by covering pH measurement with or without stirring at the time of measurement. The allocation of different method codes to cover these options reflects the fact that measurement conditions may sometimes slightly affect apparent pH results.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Apart from the method involving oxidation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is best performed on field-moist soil, other laboratory methods use air-dry soil of &#60;2 mm particle size, apart from the method based on MIR. The MIR method uses air-dry soil with a particle size of &#60;0.5 mm.</p>
<p class="indent-para">No correction for water content is made when reporting pH results, and possible specific ion effects on response of the glass electrode are assumed to be insignificant. See Method 14C1 for the determination of pH in saturation extracts and Method 20B1 for pH measurements in known ASS. International standard ISO 10390 (<a href="#ch04ref17">ISO-pH 2005</a>) covers soil pH measured in water, 0.01 M calcium chloride and in 1.0 M potassium chloride but its specification of equilibration at 20&#176;C makes it inappropriate for use in laboratories located in the tropics and sub-tropics, including many Australian laboratories, where laboratory temperatures of &#8776;23&#8211;25&#176;C are common.</p>

<p class="para"><a href="#ch04ref22">Raupach (1954)</a> examined errors associated with the laboratory measurement of pH in 1:5 soil/water suspensions. For example, the absence of equilibrium may give differences as high as 1.0 pH unit when measurements are made upon sedimenting alkaline suspensions. He reported no measurable errors due to this cause below pH 5. Neither did the presence of soluble salts modify the differences observed.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch04ref12">Ducksbury and Telford (1972)</a> have reviewed the high precision measurement of pH.

Soil pH measurements, however, mostly need no greater accuracy than &#177;0.1 unit and, quite often, circumstances do not justify this precision (<a href="#ch04ref22">Raupach 1954</a>). This is supported by <a href="#ch04ref17">ISO-pH (2005)</a> and by many years of interlaboratory soil proficiency testing by ASPAC (<a href="#ch04ref24">Rayment 2005</a>). <a href="#ch4fig2">Figure 4.2</a> shows that robust coefficients of variation (%) are independent of reported pH values by two common methods, when homogenous soils of &#60;0.5 mm were analysed by multiple laboratories. The data (sample median pH values) were sourced from ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007, including those reported by <a href="#ch04ref21">Peverill and Johnstone (1997)</a> and <a href="#ch04ref25">Rayment <em>et al.</em> (2007)</a>. See <a href="backmatter02.html#backmatter02">Appendix 2</a> for additional information on method performance.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Accuracy and precision are influenced by the &#8216;condition&#8217; of the glass electrode in particular, which is often affected by its surface properties. In particular, glass &#8216;condition&#8217; can deteriorate, sometimes quite rapidly when used continuously, and therefore benefits from &#8216;resting&#8217;; a few hours to several days may be necessary. Response characteristics can be improved and extended by soaking the glass electrode in an aqueous solution of water-structure making ions comprising lithium acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COOLi.2H<sub>2</sub>O) and lithium sulfate (Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O). In contrast, soaking in water-structure breaking ions such as sodium chloride and potassium borate invariably results in rapid deterioration of glass electrode characteristics (<a href="#ch04ref12">Ducksbury and Telford 1972</a>). An alternative is to immerse the bulb into a 10% aqueous solution of 10% ammonium hydrogen difluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>2</sub>) for 1 min, then dip in a 1:1 solution of deionised water/10 M HCl, followed by thorough rinsing with deionised water and a final wipe with a damp cloth to remove any adhering silicate. After treatment, immerse the glass electrode in a reference electrolyte at least overnight, then store in deionised or distilled water (never allow to dry up).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Operators required to measure solutions containing sulfides must remain alert to the possibility of Ag<sub>2</sub>S precipitation in the diaphragm, a condition that can be corrected by soaking/washing with a freshly prepared aqueous solution of 7% thiourea [CS(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; 2.66 g/500 mL, slightly acidified with citric acid].</p>

<p class="para">This method, adapted from <a href="#ch04ref14">Ford and Calvert (1970)</a>, is best used on &#8216;as received&#8217; (field moist) soil to obtain an indication of the presence of oxidisable sulfide ions (S<sup>2&#8211;</sup>). If present, S<sup>2&#8211;</sup> ions <a id="page_45"></a>are oxidised with heated 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to form H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, with a consequential lowering of pH. Should soil pH decline to 3.5 or less, it can be assumed that soil and drainage water acidity problems will emerge when the soil or sediment is exposed to air. The initial phases of this oxidation reaction, plus a further oxidative reaction catalysed by Fe<sup>2+</sup> as an early reaction product, are shown as Equations 4.3 to 4.5. Similar chemistry is involved in the first part of Method 20C1.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>30% Hydrogen Peroxide (H<sub>2</sub><em>O</em><sub>2</sub>)</em></p>
<p class="para">Use analytical grade, as it is common for commercial grades to contain hydrochloric acid as a stabiliser. Handle with care at all times.</p>

<p class="para">Dissolve 100 g barium chloride dihydrate (BaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O) in deionised water and make volume to 1 L.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Weigh 1 g soil (wet as received) into a 200 mL, wide-mouth conical flask. Add 20 mL of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and place on a boiling water bath. Remove from the water bath if the reaction is too vigorous. Otherwise, continue heating until the solution clears, indicating that the reaction is complete. This should take around 30 min.</p>
<p class="indent-para">As organic acids can interfere with the pH measurement it is important to ensure that all OM is destroyed.

<p class="para">This calculation provides some indication of the sign of the electrical charge currently dominant in the soil and applies particularly to acidic soils with variable-charge characteristics (<a href="#ch04ref28">Uehara and Gillman 1981</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation</em></h3>

<p class="indent-para">Report &#916; pH, including the &#8211;ive or +ive sign.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Interpretation</em></h3>
<p class="para">If &#916; pH is positive, the soil pH is probably less than the point of zero charge (pH<sub>0</sub>) and the soil carries a net positive surface charge. When &#916; pH is negative, the soil is above pH<sub>0</sub> and carries a net negative surface charge. Dominance of a soil by variable-charge colloids can generally be assumed when &#916; pH is a small negative (less than &#8211;0.5), zero, or positive value.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When &#916; pH has a large negative value, nothing can be deduced about whether the surface charge is permanent or variable. Acid soils with &#916; pH values near zero or positive can be expected to contain low levels of extractable Al (<a href="#ch04ref27">Uehara and Gillman 1980</a>) but are likely to be calcium deficient.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter04sec16"></a>4G1 Field determination of pH</h3>
<p class="para">Field measurement of soil pH is recommended practice for soil and land use surveys in Australia. While portable pH meters are now readily available and reliable, there is a long history of use of a pH kit developed by <a href="#ch04ref23">Raupach and Tucker (1959)</a>. Its vital components are barium sulfate, a mixed indicator solution and a colour-comparison chart depicting different soil pH values. Measurement precision is considered satisfactory (<a href="#ch04ref03">Aldrick 1988</a>). This is the same mixed indicator/barium sulfate method mentioned in the preamble of Method 4A1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Reagents/Apparatus</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Neutral barium sulfate (BaSO<sub>4</sub>) powder</em></p>
<p class="para">Separately prepare one litre each of half molar aqueous (deionised water) solutions of barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O; 122.1 g/L) and of sodium sulfate decahydrate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O; 161.1 g/L).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Heat about 4 litres of deionised water to boiling and add 30 mL of 10 M HCl. Keep this hot, dilute acid stirred continuously and allow the barium and sulfate solutions to run in slowly at equal rates. The addition of the reagents should take an hour or more. When the reaction is complete, allow the barium sulfate precipitate to settle and draw off the supernatant liquor. Wash the product repeatedly, preferably in a vacuum assisted Buchner funnel, until the barium sulfate precipitate has a neutral reaction to the pH indicator, then dry in an oven at around 105&#176;C to constant weight. This product may vary slightly in fineness but should be used as a &#8216;free-flowing&#8217; powder.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Mixed Indicator Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Weigh out good quality reagents of 0.2 g of phenol red &#8211; acid free (C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S), 0.12 g bromocresol purple (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>16</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S) and 0.08 g bromocresol green (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>14</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S), and grind together in a glass or agate mortar with 9 mL 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH; 3.9997/L) until all solid material has dissolved. Dilute this solution with about 70 mL of distilled (preferred) or deionised water and bring to pH 7.0 with dilute HCl or dilute NaOH, assisted by a pH meter and stirring. Make volume to 100 mL and dispense the mixed indicator using a borosilicate or plastic dropping bottle.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Colour comparator</em></h3>
<p class="para">Use the example provided on the inside back cover of this book or alternatively construct and photograph a colour scale for the particular mixed indicator across the soil pH range <a id="page_47"></a>in half-unit intervals from pH 2.0 to pH &#8805;9.5. For each calibration point on the pH scale, thoroughly mix equal amounts of around ten different soil samples known to have a pH within 0.1 unit of the desired value. The &#8216;true&#8217; colours given by these mixtures are those obtained within a few minutes of development (see Procedure below for more details).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Take a small quantity of field moist soil (&#8776;0.5 g) and mix it on a white porcelain spot tile with a few drops of the indicator to give a paste. Dust the paste with the neutral, white barium sulfate powder and compare the colour with a standard colour chart after about three min. Avoid inhalation of barium sulfate dust as long term inhalation may lead to deposition in lungs in sufficient quantities to produce baritosis &#8211; a benign pneumoconiosis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Report field pH on &#8216;field moist&#8217; soil.</p>
