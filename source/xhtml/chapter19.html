<h2 class="h2a"><strong>Alkaline earth carbonates</strong></h2>
<p class="para">Many soils, particularly those in arid and semi-arid regions such as the Calcarosols of Australia (<a href="#ch19ref02">Anon 2001</a>), contain solid-phase alkaline earth carbonates. Indeed, the presence of solid-phase carbonates is an important diagnostic feature in stratigraphic and land use studies (<a href="#ch19ref18">Wetherby and Oades 1975</a>) and in elucidating pedogenic processes. The presence or absence of carbonate is significant; the actual amount present is less important in pedogenic studies (<a href="#ch19ref09">Martin and Reeve 1955</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The most common types of alkaline earth carbonates are calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) &#8211; or a poorly crystalline equivalent &#8211; and dolomite [CaCO<sub>3</sub>&#8226;MgCO<sub>3</sub> or CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]. Less common soil carbonates include sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>). Soluble carbonates are not usually present in soils until the pH exceeds 9.5, although bicarbonates may be present at much lower soil pH values (<a href="#ch19ref06">Heanes 1981</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) equivalent is a criterion in Soil Taxonomy (<a href="#ch19ref16">Soil Survey Staff 1975</a>). It is used to define petrocalcic and calcic horizons, plus carbonatic and calcareous soil classes. In addition to classification and pedogenic implications, the presence and distribution of carbonate minerals affects soil pH and fertility, plant available water capacity, clay flocculation, etc. (e.g. <a href="#ch19ref03">Doner and Lynn 1989</a>). Accordingly, there are many and varied reasons for quantifying the types and quantities of alkaline earth carbonates in soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Method 6E1 uses loss-on-ignition to provide a semi-quantitative estimate of soil carbonate content, simultaneously with a semi-quantitative estimate of TOC. This chapter provides further laboratory and field tests to quantify (qualitatively and semi-quantitatively) the carbonate content of soils. The first laboratory method (19A1) is a rapid titration procedure developed from the method of <a href="#ch19ref12">Piper (1944)</a>, as compiled by <a href="#ch19ref17">van Reeuwijk (1986)</a>. It yields approximate values only. The second (19B1) is a manometric procedure with the ability to give satisfactory results for both calcitic and dolomitic minerals (<a href="#ch19ref09">Martin and Reeve 1955</a>; <a href="#ch19ref13">Skinner and Halstead 1958</a>; <a href="#ch19ref14">Skinner <em>et al.</em> 1959</a>). It performed well in slightly modified form in comparative tests of four methods for soil carbonates (<a href="#ch19ref10">McKeague and Sheldrick 1976</a>). Method 19B2 is similar but more convenient, as it uses a transducer to measure the increase in pressure generated by CO<sub>2</sub> released after reaction with 5.5 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). Two qualitative field tests, also involving the careful use of HCl solutions, are provided as Methods 19C1 and 19D1. <a href="#ch19tab1">Table 19.1</a> contains summary details of all the methods.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter19sec01"></a>19A1 Carbonates &#8211; rapid titration</h3>
<p class="para">In this titration procedure, soil is treated with dilute HCl and residual acid is titrated with standard 0.5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Results are referred to as &#8216;CaCO<sub>3</sub> equivalent&#8217; since the reaction is not selective for calcite; other carbonates including dolomite will be included to some extent.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter19sec02"></a>19B Carbonates by pressure change</h3>
<p class="para">The difference between Method 19B1 and Method 19B2, both of which are only moderately quantitative (e.g. <a href="#ch19ref11">Nelson 1982</a>), is that the former relies on the direct measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (&#8776;80&#8211;100 mm Hg) via a manometer (or similar), whereas Method 19B2 uses a corrosion resistant gas pressure transducer with an electrical output in volts direct current (Vdc). Method 19B2 is the more attractive, as it avoids the need to use a manometer containing liquid Hg, which (including its vapour) is a toxic heavy metal.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The methods demand close attention to operator safety associated with the use of strong acid and potentially high gas pressures, particularly when analysing soils of high carbonate content. Also, operators need to be vigilant to ensure there is no leakage of CO<sub>2</sub> and to ensure there is only minimum contact with reaction vessels to avoid the possibility of temperature changes that affect gas pressure. Incomplete chemical reaction between acid and solid-phase carbonates is a potential source of error (low results), while positive errors can occur: (i) should sulfides and sulfites form gaseous hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide in the presence of acid and heat, and (ii) should the decarboxylation of organic compounds produce CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#ch19ref11">Nelson 1982</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter19sec03"></a>19B1 Carbonates by pressure change &#8211; manometric</h3>
<p class="para">This method is based on measurement of pressure change with time (constant temperature) via a manometer in a closed system, as CO<sub>2</sub> is evolved following reaction of carbonate with a solution of HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub>. Ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>) is incorporated to prevent interference from reactions of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) with OM in the presence of HCl (<a href="#ch19ref09">Martin and Reeve 1955</a>). Calcite (or limestone) can be estimated separately from dolomite because the reaction rate of the former is more rapid. Fine grinding to &#60;0.5 mm helps ensure the reagents have sufficient surface area to achieve complete reaction with contained carbonates. The effervescent chemical reaction based on calcite is as follows:</p>
<p class="center-para">CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl &#8594; H<sub>2</sub> O + CO<sub>2</sub>&#8593; + Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 2Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_418"></a><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>4 M Hydrochloric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">Dilute 400 mL of 10 M HCl by adding acid to water, mix and make volume to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Solution</em></p>
<p class="para">Dissolve 30 g ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O) in 1.0 L of 4 M HCl immediately prior to use.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Acid-washed Sand</em></p>
<p class="para">As for Method 15B1. Alternatively, treat a batch of high-grade silica sand with 5.5 M HCl in the same proportions described in this procedure. Subsequently, wash the sand free of any residual acidity with deionised water, oven-dry (105&#176;C), cool and store.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Into a clean 20 or 25 mL vial, weigh 5.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;0.5 mm). There should be sufficient carbonate present to give a final manometer reading of 80&#8211;100 mm Hg. If &#60;5.0 g soil is needed, add a corresponding weight of Acid-washed Sand to the vial. Float the vial plus soil on 30 mL HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Solution in a 700 mL wide mouth reaction bottle.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Insert a two-hole stopper carrying a thermometer and a glass tube (fitted with a gas-tight stopcock) into each reaction bottle (the seal should be gas tight). Clamp the reaction bottles into a wrist-action shaker and connect a Hg manometer (or a hand-held gauge and differential manometer, such as Omega Engineering&#8217;s PCL-200 series or equivalent; <a href="#ch19ref01">Anon 1996</a>). Arrange the apparatus so that at least the reaction bottle is maintained at &#8776;25&#176;C in a waterbath or constant temperature room. After checking the zero reading of the manometer, set the shaker in motion (contents of the vial must make contact with the HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Solution) and with vigorous shaking (and the stopcock open) make periodic readings of the manometer until no change in pressure occurs. Temperature should also be recorded and if not at 25&#176;C, an appropriate correction should be made (see Note 1); heat of neutralisation is unlikely to raise temperature appreciably. Use insulated gloves to prevent heat transfer when handling the reaction bottles. Also react a known weight (e.g. 0.05 g) of pure, dry CaCO<sub>3</sub> as a check on the analytical procedure, the equipment and the quality of reagents. Method 19B2 provides examples.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Subtract manometer readings (H<sub>t1</sub>; H<sub>t2</sub>; H<sub>t3</sub>; etc), recorded at each time interval from the final manometer reading (H<sub>f</sub>). Plot log (H<sub>f</sub>&#8211;H<sub>t</sub>) against time (s); log-linear graph paper or spreadsheet is convenient. Extrapolate the straight-line portion of the plot occurring after about 60 sec to zero time. This intercept value (H<sub>d</sub>) represents CO<sub>2</sub> derived from dolomite; the difference between the final reading and the intercept (H<sub>f</sub>&#8211;H<sub>d</sub>) represents CO<sub>2</sub> from calcite (or limestone). Examples are given in <a href="#ch19fig1">Figure 19.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Convert these values to g CO<sub>2</sub> by means of a standard curve (or regression equation) prepared by measuring CO<sub>2</sub> evolved from different amounts of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The deficit in weight of CaCO<sub>3</sub> from that of a 5 g soil sample should be compensated for by addition of acid-washed sand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine actual weights of CO<sub>2</sub> from calcite and/or dolomite using theoretical CO<sub>2</sub> contents of 43.97% and 47.73%, respectively: see Note 2 for additional examples. Adjust for weight of soil used.</p>

<p class="para">This method is chemically similar to Method 19B1, except it uses a corrosion-resistant gas-pressure transducer (see Note 1) with a direct current voltage (Vdc) range sufficient to quantify the pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> developed by chemical reaction as the measurement step. As the chemical reaction is performed in a closed vessel at constant temperature, the pressure increase within the vessel is proportional to the amount of carbonate in the soil, assuming the chemical reaction goes to completion. In addition to soils, the method has been applied to marine sediments with very high carbonate contents of &#62;80% (<a href="#ch19ref04">Fernandes <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>).</p>

<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_422"></a>Spot-check the transducer-voltage reading vs corresponding soil-equivalent % CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentration with each batch of unknown samples to ensure the equipment is performing within specifications. Accordingly, accurately weigh, for example, 0.04 g of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (as previously described) plus 1.96 g Silica Sand, into a separate 40 mL vial. Into this, insert a 4 mL vial containing 2.0 mL of 5.5 M HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent and proceed as described above. If the voltage does not correspond to that predicted from the calibration plot (or regression equation) recheck the equipment and (if necessary) re-establish the calibration relationship with the same or a replacement transducer.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Sample Extraction and Measurement</em></p>
<p class="para">Into each 40 mL vial containing 2.0 g of air-dry soil (&#60;0.5 mm), insert a 4 mL vial containing 2.0 mL of 5.5 M HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent, then seal each 40 mL vial with a gas-tight screw cap and septum. Next invert carefully, allowing the HCl-FeCl<sub>2</sub> Reagent and the soil sample to come into full contact, swirl to mix, then allow the chemical reaction to proceed at ambient temperature for 2 h with occasional swirling. The temperature of the contents of the vials at the time of recording transducer-voltages should be the same as that used for calibration of the equipment, ideally 25&#176;C. Make sequential transducer-voltage measurements as described in the System Calibration and Measurement sub-section. Voltages for all samples should be within the range of the calibration standard plot. It is, however, recommended the analysis of unknown samples be repeated if the transducer output of the type described exceeds 5&#8211;6 Vdc. In such circumstances, the sample weight should be lowered to &#8804;1.0 g with Silica Sand used to bring the sample + sand weight to 2.0 g. Allowance for this &#8216;dilution&#8217; must be made when reporting results.</p>

<p class="para">Solutions of hydrochloric acid (HCl), commonly 1.0 M or 3.0 M, offer a rapid, qualitative way of indicating the presence of soil carbonates in the field (e.g. <a href="#ch19ref15">Soil Survey Division Staff 1993</a>). The chemical reaction described in Method 19B1 applies. The test does not substitute for the rapid &#8216;effervescence class assessment&#8217; coded as Method 19D1. For precise studies, more quantitative tests are recommended.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Reagents</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>1 M Hydrochloric Acid</em></p>
<p class="para">Dilute 100 mL of 10 M HCl, mix and make volume to 1.0 L with deionised water.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>3.0 M Hydrochloric Acid</em></p>

<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Bedrock and Bedrock Fragment Identification</em></p>
<p class="para">Carefully add one or two drops of (initially) 1.0 M HCl to a small sample of bedrock fragment on a spot-plate, if necessary after the &#8216;specimen&#8217; is scratched, broken, or powdered by a rock hammer to expose fresh material or to increase the surface area. If CO<sub>2</sub> effervescence is quickly apparent, this likely indicates the presence of limestone. If the reaction is slow and/or insignificant after waiting 2&#8211;3 min, repeat the procedure but substitute with 3.0 M HCl. Dolomite, if present, reacts slowly and to a lesser degree than limestone. Record the field observation, usually as presence or absent with respect to carbonates.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Carbonate Concretions (nodules, threads, masses, etc.)</em></p>
<p class="para">Take prior action to break-up hard concretions, weathering rinds, or coatings of non-reactive material prior to testing. For example, crush the specimen to increase the surface area and to expose fresh mineral surfaces, noting that dolomite rarely forms as a secondary or authigenic (formed in place) mineral in soil. Carefully add one or two drops of (initially) 1.0 M HCl and subsequently, on a fresh specimen, a few drops of 3.0 M HCl. Use a spot plate and allow around 1&#8211;2 min for the HCl to react. Interpret as described for bedrock and bedrock fragments above and record the field observation/s, usually as presence or absent with respect to carbonates.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Carbonates in the Soil Matrix</em></p>
<p class="para">Select a representative (&#60;2 mm particle size) soil specimen, noting that carbonates may be primary, secondary, or both, while carbonates may occur in discrete locations such as along the faces of peds. A positive reaction confirms the presence of carbonates. The specimen can be placed on a spot plate and given 1&#8211;2 min to react (see Note 1). Initially use 1.0 M HCl and, if observations are inconclusive, use 3.0 M HCl. Record the field observation, usually as presence or absent with respect to carbonates.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Note</em></strong></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;As dolomitic carbonates react slowly; the reaction can be easily overlooked. Also, carbonates may occur in specific locations, such as along the face of peds. To capture this potential diversity, soil specimens from several locations throughout the profile should be tested.</p>

<p class="para">This qualitative field test (<a href="#ch19ref15">Soil Survey Division Staff 1993</a>) uses 1.0 M HCl to provide a rapid means of confirming the presence of soil carbonates and their &#8216;effervescence class&#8217;. As such, the test provides a relative index of the amount of carbonates in the soil matrix. The test relies on the visible effervescence of CO<sub>2</sub> when dilute HCl reacts with carbonate minerals in the soil. The rate and extent of effervescence are affected by the chemical and physical nature of the carbonates present, including particle size and mineralogy, together with other variables such as temperature, water content and the strength of the HCl. The chemical reaction described in Method 19B1 applies.</p>
