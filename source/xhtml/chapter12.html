<h2 class="h2a">Micronutrients</h2>
<p class="para">There is increasing use of micronutrient and heavy metal tests for soil fertility and resource-condition assessments. Major objectives of soil fertility tests are to separate deficient from non-deficient soils, and to indicate when a profitable response to applications of specific micronutrients might be expected. Soil tests are also used to indicate possible nutrient and heavy metal toxicities. For example, toxicities of Cu and Zn can develop from the repeated use of crop-protection fungicides based on these elements (<a href="#ch12ref37">Rayment and Brooks 1974</a>). For recent reviews with an Australian emphasis, including examples of interpretative criteria, see <a href="#ch12ref03">Armour and Brennan (1999)</a> for Zn, <a href="#ch12ref05">Bell (1999)</a> for B, <a href="#ch12ref09">Brennan and Best (1999)</a> for Cu, <a href="#ch12ref10">Brennan and Bruce (1999)</a> for Mo, <a href="#ch12ref30">McFarlane (1999)</a> for Fe, and <a href="#ch12ref51">Uren (1999)</a> for Mn. Examples from Brazil have been reported by <a href="#ch12ref14">de Abreu <em>et al.</em> (2005)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Because micronutrients and heavy metals exist in soils in water-soluble, exchangeable, adsorbed, chelated, and complexed forms, as well as in secondary clay minerals, insoluble metal oxides and in primary minerals (<a href="#ch12ref13">Cox and Kamprath 1972</a>; <a href="#ch12ref50">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>), a wide range of laboratory methods are used for their determination in soils. The methods included are the DTPA test for Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn (<a href="#ch12ref25">Lindsay and Norvell 1969a</a>, <a href="#ch12ref27">1978</a>); an ammonium bicarbonate-ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>/EDTA) test for Cu and Zn (<a href="#ch12ref07">Best <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>); a 0.1 M HCl extraction for Cu and Zn in canelands (e.g. <a href="#ch12ref41">Reghenzani 1990</a>); hot, aqueous CaCl<sub>2</sub> for B (<a href="#ch12ref01">Aitken <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>); and a CaCl<sub>2</sub> extractant for extractable Mo. More details on these micronutrient soil tests (see <a href="#ch12tab1">Table 12.1</a> for summary details) plus comparative inter-laboratory analytical performance data (where available), are given in preambles to individual methods and in <a href="backmatter02.html#backmatter02">Appendix 2</a>. Methods 12A to 12C, inclusive, were similarly coded in <a href="#ch12ref38">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">All the tests are empirically based: they are dependent on strict adherence to method specifications. It is also important at all times to avoid all sources of possible contamination. Measurement is mostly by ICPAES. Atomic absorption is an alternative for the heavy metals, a manual colorimetric option is available for soil B, and ICP-MS is preferred for Mo analysis at low concentrations.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter12sec01"></a>12A1 DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe</h3>
<p class="para">Extracting solutions containing chelating agents such as diethylenetriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) removes micronutrient cations adsorbed on solid phases together with water-soluble constituents. As such, the test may simulate the action of plant roots. Consequently, extraction with DTPA has been used to assess the micronutrient fertility of soils (<a href="#ch12ref25">Lindsay and Norvell 1969a</a>, <a href="#ch12ref27">1978</a>). The test was inferior to dilute CaCl<sub>2</sub> for predicting the availability of soil Cd to a wide range of vegetables (<a href="#ch12ref36">Rayment 1994</a>), while <a href="#ch12ref31">Menzies <em>et al.</em> (2007)</a> report that neutral salt extractants appear to provide the most useful prediction of trace metal phytoavailability.</p>

<p class="indent-para1">This widely used method involves equilibration of air-dry soil for 2 h with extracting solution at a soil/solution ratio of 1:2. Triethanolamine helps buffer the extracting solution close to pH 7.3 and thus restricts dissolution of trace metals from soils of high pH. A pH around 7.3 also favours formation of the Zn-DTPA complex (<a href="#ch12ref26">Lindsay and Norvell 1969b</a>), whereas CaCl<sub>2</sub> acts to suppress carbonate solubility in calcareous soil.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soil preparation, time of extraction and temperature of extraction affect results obtained by empirical methods for heavy metals (<a href="#ch12ref45">Soltanpour <em>et al.</em> 1976</a>, <a href="#ch12ref46">1979</a>; <a href="#ch12ref23">Houba and Novozamsky 1998</a>) so adherence to the described procedure is essential. It is reported that soil grinding and the method of grinding can change the apparent amount of DTPA-heavy metals present (<a href="#ch12ref02">Anon 2000</a>). Soils can be stored in an air-dry condition, however, for several months with no measurable effects on the amount of Zn and Cu extracted.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nowadays, measurement of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn by ICPAES is preferred but AAS provides an acceptable alternative analytical finish for DTPA-extractable heavy metals. <a href="#ch12fig1">Figure 12.1</a> shows the influence of elemental concentrations of DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn on percent robust coefficients of variation (Robust % CVs) from interlaboratory proficiency programs of the ASPAC from 1997&#8211;2007 (<a href="#ch12ref35">e.g. Peverill and Johnstone 1997</a>; <a href="#ch12ref40">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). All 72 soils used were air-dry and finely ground, while laboratories used either ICPAES or AAS for the analytical finish. Grand median robust % CVs were 11, 14, 15 and 23% for grand median soil concentrations of 29.4, 1.42, 0.82 and 46.8 mg/kg for Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe, respectively.</p>

<p class="para">Although the DTPA-TEA-CaCl<sub>2</sub> extractant (Method 12A1) has wide use for assessing the Cu and Zn status of soils, its value as a diagnostic tool to predict trace metal impurities has been questioned (<a href="#ch12ref20">e.g. Haq and Miller 1972</a>; <a href="#ch12ref44">Singh <em>et al.</em> 1977</a>; <a href="#ch12ref16">Grundon and Best 1982)</a>.</p>

They suggested the method offered a satisfactory theoretical basis for application to both neutral and high-lime soils, as the extractant suppresses dissolution of carbonates and oxides.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter12sec03"></a>12C1 Calcium chloride-extractable B &#8211; manual colour</h3>
<p class="para">Hot water extraction of soil B (<a href="#ch12ref06">Berger and Truog 1939</a>) is widely used to obtain an index of soil B status for plant growth. Unfortunately, the method presents difficulties for routine analysis <a id="page_242"></a>because extracts free of colloidal material are difficult to obtain. <a href="#ch12ref12">Cartwright <em>et al.</em> (1983)</a> proposed 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>-0.05 M mannitol [C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>] as an alternative to hot water extraction because it was suited to analysis by ICPAES. Subsequent research (<a href="#ch12ref01">Aitken <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>) has shown that hot 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> is a superior predictor of B deficiency, especially in acid and near neutral soils. The method is highly correlated with hot water-soluble B.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The hot CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable soil B method described is based on refluxing air-dry soil for 10 min with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> at a 1:2 soil/solution ratio. After replacing liquid lost during reflux, extracts are filtered while hot and allowed to cool. In this method, B is determined by an azomethine-H colorimetric procedure based on methods described by <a href="#ch12ref19">Gupta and Stewart (1975)</a>, <a href="#ch12ref17">Gupta (1979)</a>, <a href="#ch12ref15">Gaines and Mitchell (1979)</a>, <a href="#ch12ref34">Parker and Gardner (1981)</a>, and <a href="#ch12ref08">Bloesch (1985)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Colorimetric determination of B is an option when ICPAES is not available. The azomethine-H finish is preferred over other colorimetric procedures for soil B as its colour is developed in aqueous medium. Other colorimetric procedures for determining B, including carminic acid (<a href="#ch12ref21">Hatcher and Wilcox 1950</a>) and curcumin (<a href="#ch12ref22">Hayes and Metcalfe 1962</a>) require concentrated acids or organic solvents. The method takes account of evidence (<a href="#ch12ref08">Bloesch 1985</a>) that time affects the absorbance of a B&#8211;azomethine-H solution, especially at low B concentrations. Brij 35 Wetting Agent is included to improve the flow of solution to the spectrophotometer.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Comparative data between ICPAES and azomethine-H on CaCl<sub>2</sub> extracts of soil (<a href="#ch12ref34">Parker and Gardner 1981</a>; AJ Jeffrey, pers. comm.) suggest that ICPAES will yield slightly lower B values in most cases.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is confirmation for these observations in results reported in ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs. For example, the median values for the azomethine-H method in 2004&#8211;05 (<a href="#ch12ref40">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>) averaged around 9% higher than results obtained by ICPAES, although there were a few samples where the reverse occurred. Continuous relations between soil B concentrations by azomethine-H and robust % CV are unavailable because of limited numbers of laboratory participants for this test in ASPAC interlaboratory proficiency programs.

<p class="para">This is a fast, simple procedure for determining B in soil extracts when an ICPAES is available, especially when large sample numbers are involved (<a href="#ch12ref52">Zarcinas and Cartwright 1983</a>). After filtration, no further sample preparation is necessary before analysis by ICPAES. When readings are carried out at 208.9 nm, no interferences occur at elemental levels normally encountered in soil extracts.

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter12sec06"></a>12E1 Calcium chloride-extractable Mo</h3>
<p class="para">The average abundance of total Mo in the earth&#8217;s crust is around 1.5 mg/kg: soils average around 2.0 mg Mo/kg (<a href="#ch12ref50">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>), while total Mo concentrations in surface soils from Queensland canelands average 1.46 &#177; 2.14 mg/kg (<a href="#ch12ref39">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). Typical total concentrations in common minerals include 0.2 mg Mo/kg in sandstones, 1&#8211;1.5 mg Mo/kg in basalts, 1.4&#8211;2.0 mg Mo/kg in granites, to around 3.0 mg Mo/kg in shales, noting that black bituminous shales can have total Mo concentrations of &#8776;70 mg/kg (<a href="#ch12ref50">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). Soil Mo concentrations typically increase with soil depth (<a href="#ch12ref39">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Chemically, Mo occurs in soils at oxidation states Mo<sup>3+</sup> to Mo<sup>6+</sup>, with Mo<sup>6+</sup> species favoured under oxidising conditions and Mo<sup>3+</sup> in reducing conditions. Naturally occurring sulfides of Mo (these can co-occur with sulfides of Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn) have low water solubility and are unavailable to plants.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Molybdenite oxidises fairly easily to MoO<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (this is water soluble) and eventually to H<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>, which can migrate in soil solution until lost by leaching or &#8216;fixed&#8217; by chemical sorption as a complex anion or (less common) in exchangeable cationic forms as a consequence of reduction with OM. Total Mo in soils commonly correlates with clay-size fractions (<a href="#ch12ref50">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Most arable soils in Australia and New Zealand that were naturally low in P also have limited reserves of plant-available Mo. Moreover, those with a medium to high propensity to &#8216;fix&#8217; P typically have low plant-available Mo, irrespective of total Mo status. Moreover, Mo deficiencies in higher plants (particularly legumes and some vegetables) are likely to occur in soils with a pH (1:5 soil/water) &#60;5.5 to 6.0. (This is common across coastal Australian soils supplied with fertiliser phosphate.) Molybdenum deficiency rarely occurs in plants, including legumes, grown on alkaline soils. The unavailability of Mo in acidic soils is associated with Al/Mo and Mn/Mo antagonisms. There is excellent evidence demonstrating that liming of acidic <a id="page_247"></a>soils can overcome at least moderate Mo deficiency in pasture legumes, while soil &#8216;wetness&#8217; is reported to increase the uptake of Mo by higher plants.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Typical recommendations to overcome Mo deficiency in legume-based sub-tropical and tropical pastures are to apply from 50 to 100 g Mo/ha every 3 to 4 years, when soil pH (1:5 soil/water) is &#60;7.0. For Mo sensitive species such as the desmodiums, when grown on strongly Mo fixing soils such as the Ferrosols, recommended application rates can be up to 200 g Mo/ha every 2 to 3 years. Vegetable growers often (unwisely) apply more than these quantities. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO<sub>3</sub>; 66% Mo) and sodium molybdate (Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O; 39% Mo) are the most commonly used Mo fertilisers.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There are well known Cu-Mo and Cu-Mo-S interrelationships in farm animals (e.g. the nervous disorder referred to as swayback in sheep due to Cu deficiency; teartness in cattle). In New Zealand, 10 mg Mo/kg in pasture dry matter was found to be &#8216;toxic&#8217; when pasture Cu content was normal. Furthermore, concentrations in the range 3&#8211;10 mg Mo/kg were harmful to farm animals when Cu intake was low. That said, Mo mostly gives little cause for concern from a medical viewpoint, although there may be some association between ingestion of elevated levels of Mo (in water/food) and the incidence of dental caries in high Mo areas. There is some interest in levels of xanthine oxidase and uric acid levels in workers occupationally exposed to Mo.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Fifty g/ha/y of Mo was a loading rate suggested for sludge by <a href="#ch12ref47">Tjell (1985)</a> but <a href="#ch12ref29">McBride and Hale (2004)</a> see the need for downwards movement of these upper soil-loading limits.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The literature indicates little success in demonstrating a reliable soil chemical test for phyto-available soil Mo, although several have been &#8216;trialled&#8217; with limited local success (<a href="#ch12ref18">e.g. Gupta 1993</a>). <a href="#ch12ref29">McBride and Hale (2004)</a> had reasonable success in relating hot (90&#176;C) 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>-extractable Mo with concentrations of Mo in alfalfa (lucerne) following long-term additions of sewage sludge. This &#8216;experimental&#8217; empirical test is similar to that of <a href="#ch12ref29">McBride and Hale (2004)</a>, but has a slightly narrower soil/solution ratio of 1:2, a shorter extraction time of 10 min, and a slightly higher reflux temperature of 100&#176;C, which equates to those for soil B by Method 12C. Corresponding specifications used by <a href="#ch12ref29">McBride and Hale (2004)</a> are 1:2.5, 30 min and reflux at 90&#176;C. Final analysis by ICP-MS (preferred), by electrothermal atomisation AAS, or by a sensitive ICPAES is required.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Expect &#8216;normal&#8217; background levels for this test of around 0.01 mg Mo/kg, whereas values &#8805;0.03 mg Mo/kg probably indicate the presence of more-than sufficient soil Mo reserves. Other factors also operate, such as soil pH.</p>
