<p class="para">Concentrated salt solutions provide one alternative for the displacement of exchangeable bases and other cations from soils. Displacement, however, can be achieved at low solution ionic strength, provided the absorption affinity for soil colloids of the index cation selected is much larger than the absorption affinities of typical soil cations. Chhabra <em>et al.</em> (1975) demonstrated that the monovalent silver-thiourea complex (AgTU<sup>+</sup>) can serve this purpose. Subsequently, a single extraction method using unbuffered AgTU<sup>+</sup> was found to be suitable for rapid determination of ECEC and exchangeable cations in soils dominated by low-activity clays with variable surface charges (<a href="#ch15ref41">Pleysier and Juo 1980</a>). These researchers and Searle (1986) demonstrated that amounts of individual exchangeable bases extracted by both neutral NH<sub>4</sub>OAc and 0.01 M AgTU<sup>+</sup> were usually highly correlated, although there can be differences. For example, Searle (1986) reported that NH<sub>4</sub>OAc could extract higher amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> in some soils. In contrast, 0.01 M AgTU<sup>+</sup> appears able to extract more K<sup>+</sup> than NH<sub>4</sub>OAc in soils containing interlayer K<sup>+</sup> associated with vermiculite and partly weathered mica (<a href="#ch15ref41">Pleysier and Juo 1980</a>). The reverse can also apply in other soils (<a href="#ch15ref49">Searle 1986</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_331"></a>This method is based on that reported by <a href="#ch15ref07">Blakemore <em>et al</em>. (1987)</a>. It involves equilibration of air-dry soil and 0.01 M AgTU<sup>+</sup> for 16 h, with end-over-end shaking, followed by centrifugation and analysis of exchangeable bases. Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> are included prior to analysis by AAS to prevent possible interferences from phosphate and ionisation, respectively. The residual extract is required for the determination of other ion exchange properties. As highly weathered soils of low ionic strength (e.g. <em>I</em> &#60;0.01) usually contain low levels of salinity, there is no provision for removal of soluble salts.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;To ensure the formol titration is quantitative, a large excess of formaldehyde is required. Moreover, to avoid any possibility of solution alkalinity caused by reaction of the displacing solution with soil, the Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + KNO<sub>3</sub> solution is collected into dilute HNO<sub>3</sub>. The titre between pH 5.0 and 8.2 corresponds to the total NH<sub>4</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>, when corrected by the blank titre of an aliquot of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> &#8211; KNO<sub>3</sub> &#8211; HNO<sub>3</sub> solution.</p>
