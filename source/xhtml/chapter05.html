<h2 class="h2a">Soluble chloride</h2>
<p class="para">Chloride (Cl) is the most commonly occurring water-soluble anion in seasonally dry Australian soils. Although essential for plant growth, the importance of this anion in land use assessment is due to its possible accumulation in soil profiles and waters to levels detrimental to plant growth and ecosystem health. Typical concentrations in Australian soils, where Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> has been studied extensively, range from almost zero to well in excess of 1000 mg Cl/kg. Soil solution concentrations are known to vary widely (e.g. zero to 32.3 mM; <a href="#ch05ref01">Adams 1974</a>), while the median total concentration for soils worldwide is &#8776;100 mg Cl/kg (<a href="#ch05ref22">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Chlorides in soils originated from salts trapped in parent materials, from volcanic emissions, from marine encroachment and aerosols, as a component of commercial fertilisers such as muriate of potash, and as a soluble anion in irrigation and effluent waters. The Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentration in soil solution likely to cause crop damage is dependent upon environmental conditions, the particular crop, and on irrigation management practices. Symptoms of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> toxicity in plants include burning of leaf tips or margins, bronzing and premature yellowing of leaves, and leaf drop (<a href="#ch05ref08">Chapman 1966</a>). Chloride is actively absorbed into plant cells and, if the concentration is high enough, it may interfere with the uptake and transport of essential nutrients within and between cells.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Elevated Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations (&#8776;600&#8211;1500 mg/kg of water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>) in surface soils (0&#8211;150 mm) correlate with progressively higher concentrations of Cd in potato tubers (<a href="#ch05ref13">McLaughlin <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>). Similar findings were earlier reported (<a href="#ch05ref07">Bingham <em>et al.</em> 1983</a>) for Swiss chard, namely that plant concentrations of Cd increased with increasing concentrations of sodium chloride salinity. Relatively stable Cd&#8211;Cl complexes are expected because Cd<sup>2+</sup> is a soft Lewis acid and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> exhibits some characteristics of a softish Lewis base (<a href="#ch05ref12">Lund <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is little call for information on total soil Cl levels. Particularly in the ancient landscapes of sub-humid to semi-arid Australia, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> derived from marine sediments, rocks and rainfall migrated with water movement to eventually accumulate in many subsoils, sometimes to high levels. Hydrological changes associated with land clearing, cultivation, drainage and irrigation, subsequently mobilised significant amounts of the salt, sometimes into waterways, to the soil surface or to deeper layers of the soil profile. The measurement of water-soluble soil Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> at a range of depths helps quantify these changes and the effects of different land and crop management options. <a href="#ch05ref10">Harris and Bond (1960)</a> have reported on the problems of soil salinity in turf wicket management. Dryland salinity currently affects more than 5 million hectares of land in Australia (<a href="#ch05ref03">Anon 2004</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Values of water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> useful for the general interpretation of soil chemical analyses, irrespective of sampling depth, are: &#60;100, 100&#8211;300, 300&#8211;600, 600&#8211;2000 and &#62;2000 mg Cl/kg dry wt for ratings of very low, low, medium, high and very high, respectively (<a href="#ch05ref17">Rayment and Bruce 1984</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 5.1.</strong> The effects of methods of measurement of water-soluble soil chloride on % robust CVs derived from ASPAC soil inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007. The trends are highly significant.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The laboratory estimation of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> soluble in aqueous extracts (1:5 soil/water) can be performed (following filtration or centrifugation) by any of the four methods described (5A1&#8211;5A4), with little expected influence on the numeric values obtained. The methods described involve (i) a potentiometric titration procedure; (ii) automated colorimetric analysis, based on the reaction of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> with ferric nitrate and mercuric thiocyanate (automated ferricyanide method); (iii) the use of ion chromatography (two techniques), and (iv) ICPAES (e.g. Spectroflame<sup>&#8482;</sup> ICP) at a wavelength of 134.724 nm. See preambles to individual methods for more details. Remotely sensed electromagnetic measurements made in the field that rely on the common finding that soil EC increases with increasing salinity is beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Choice of laboratory method is largely an issue of preference and the laboratory&#8217;s level of instrumental sophistication and operator training. Another consideration is relative analytical performance, with some data provided in <a href="#ch5fig1">Figure 5.1</a> and in <a href="backmatter02.html#backmatter02">Appendix 2</a>. <a href="#ch5fig1">Figure 5.1</a> shows how robust coefficients of variation (%) have varied with soil Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations by the two most common methods used across Australasia. The data (sample median Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> values) were sourced from ASPAC inter-laboratory proficiency programs from 1997&#8211;2007, including those reported by <a href="#ch05ref15">Peverill and Johnstone (1997)</a> and <a href="#ch05ref19">Rayment <em>et al.</em> (2007)</a>. For those programs, homogenous soil samples of &#60;0.5 mm were analysed by multiple laboratories. Across those years, Method 5A2a was better performed than was Method 5A1, particularly at soil concentrations &#60;50 mg Cl/kg.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch5tab1">Table 5.1</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter for measuring water-soluble Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>. More details on each are provided in method preambles.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter05sec01"></a>5A1 Chloride &#8211; 1:5 soil/water extract, potentiometric titration</h3>
<p class="para">This method carries the same code in <a href="#ch05ref18">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>. Chloride ions in clarified soil/water extracts are determined by potentiometric titration with AgNO<sub>3</sub> in conjunction with an Ag/AgNO<sub>3</sub> electrode array. For routine soil testing of non-contaminated rural lands, it is usual to assume no interfering ions of consequence are present. I<sup>&#8211;</sup> and Br<sup>&#8211;</sup> are titrated as Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, however, so may need to be considered when soil samples are derived from mine spoil, contaminated land and the like. The same applies to ferricyanide, which causes high results and should be destroyed if known to be present in measurable concentrations. Interference from chromate and dichromate ions can be avoided by reducing them to the chromic state, or by their removal. Ferric iron also interferes when present in substantially greater amounts than Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>).</p>

<p class="indent-para1">This titration-based method has long been used for assessing the Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> salinity of Australian soils, but it offers few analytical advantages over an alternative (not included) based on a mercurimetric titration, except when soil extracts are deeply coloured.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Apparatus</em></h3>
<p class="para"><em>Silver/Silver Chloride Electrode</em></p>
<p class="para">Silver (Ag)/silver chloride (AgCl) electrodes can be obtained commercially or manufactured from a length (&#8776;15 cm &#215; &#8776;1.6 mm dia) of Ag wire attached to an electrical connection of a millivolt meter or equivalent. The clean Ag wire (preclean with 30% HNO<sub>3</sub> until effervescence just commences) should be coated with a thin layer of AgCl by electrolysis. Pre-clean the Ag wire with fine emery paper followed by 30% HNO<sub>3</sub> until effervescence just commences, then immerse (to about 1 cm) in 0.1M HCl and connect to the positive terminal of a 2 volt battery. Connect a Pt electrode to the negative pole through a variable resistance and ammeter. Pass a <a id="page_52"></a>current of 3 to 4 milliamps until an even covering of AgCl deposits on the Ag wire. This should take from 1 to 30 min. For convenience, prepare several electrodes in the session and store in an aqueous NaCl solution of about 2000 mg/L. When not in use, store the electrodes in water. It is necessary to clean and recoat the Ag/AgCl electrodes occasionally but, with care, they should last for several years (<a href="#ch05ref16">Piper 1944</a>).</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Double Junction Calomel Electrode</em></p>
<p class="para">Use a calomel electrode with a secondary salt bridge of saturated potassium nitrate to prevent leakage of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> into the test solutions.

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter05sec02"></a>5A2a Chloride &#8211; 1:5 soil/water extract, automated colour</h3>
<p class="para">This method, coded as 5A2 in <a href="#ch05ref18">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>, involves SFA, a system broadly described elsewhere (e.g. <a href="#ch05ref09">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>; Section 4120 of <a href="#ch05ref05">APHA 2005</a>). The SFA systems herein outlined are examples based on AutoAnalyzer I/II technology and microbore technology. It is recognised that improvements in system performance are ongoing, including faster rates of analysis, lower reagent volumes, more reliability, automatic data handling, sample dilution and speedier reagent change-over. Reductions in dispersion have centred on smaller internal diameters of reaction tubing, down from 2.4 mm in the Technicon AutoAnalyzer I, to 2 mm in the AutoAnalyzer II, and to 1 mm in more modern instruments (<a href="#ch05ref11">Jodo <em>et al.</em> 1992</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The latest systems incorporate a better understanding of the way in which dispersion, tubing diameter and flow rate are interrelated (<a href="#ch05ref09">Gordon <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>). Continuous flow instrumentation uses a peristaltic pump to draw sample extracts from the sampler into a manifold designed to mix the samples with reagents that are being continuously pumped at predetermined flow rates, and on eventually to the colorimeter detector. The analyst must be guided by the operational instructions and directions given by the manufacturer. This could require changes to the specified reagents and to the flow diagram provided for this method.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Basis of the colorimetric reaction used is the formation &#8211; in the presence of ferric ions and free thiocyanate ions &#8211; of highly coloured ferric thiocyanate in proportion to Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentrations. Source of the thiocyanate ions is mercuric thiocyanate; thiocyanate ions are liberated when soluble mercuric chloride forms. Although I<sup>&#8211;</sup> and Br<sup>&#8211;</sup> are also measured along with Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (TA Beech, <a href="http://pers.comm">pers.comm</a>.), it is normally assumed for natural soils that this automated ferricyanide method has no interferences of significance (<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>).</p>

<p class="para">Flow injection analysis systems typically operate at high sensitivity. The technology involves introducing, under the force of a peristaltic pump, a precisely measured volume of liquid sample from the sampler into a continuously flowing carrier stream. An injection valve with a <a id="page_55"></a>fixed-volume sample loop or an injection valve with a fixed time period determines the injected volume of sample. A carrier stream sweeps the sample out of the loop and into the manifold where it disperses. The concentration gradient formed is detected continuously by (in this case) a colour reaction that occurs in the presence of continuously flowing reaction solutions (see Section 4130 of <a href="#ch05ref05">APHA 2005</a> for further details of the technology).</p>

<p class="para">Ion chromatography permits quantitative determination of common anions (F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, Br<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>) in known aqueous matrices within the mg/L concentration range or lower. The technology can effectively distinguish the halides (F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Br<sup>&#8211;</sup>) and eliminates the need to use hazardous reagents during analysis (<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>). The technique is not commonly recommended for F<sup>&#8211;</sup> in unknown matrices for reasons including possible interference from simple organic acids (formic, carbonic, etc.) that elute close to F<sup>&#8211;</sup>. There are &#8216;work-arounds&#8217; using special columns with dilute eluent or gradient elution with NaOH. Ion <a id="page_57"></a>chromatography analyses can be completed sequentially within 30 min or less using a few mL of extract. Alternative IC technology with electronic suppression of eluent conductivity and conductivity detection is also available (see Method 5A3b). Analysts should note that Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> (if present) elute close together and therefore are potential interferences for each other (<a href="#ch05ref06">ASTM 2000</a>). Also, if a particular anion is present at a high concentration, it may interfere by causing a very large peak on the chromatogram, causing other peaks to be masked. Such interferences are often avoided by dilution and/or via the use of specialised columns.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determination of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> concentration, in conjunction with the other anions mentioned, involves injecting a finely filtered aliquot (&#8804;0.45 &#956;m, with &#60;0.20 &#956;m membrane filter preferred) of the 1:5 soil/water extract into an IC appropriately configured. In the system described, based on <a href="#ch05ref14">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> (1984)</a>, the sample is pumped through three different ion exchange columns and then into a conductivity detector.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The first column (pre-column) acts as a guard, protecting the second or separator column from fouling by particulates including OM. The separator column typically contains a styrene divinylbenzene-based anion exchange resin of low capacity, designed to separate anions based on their affinity for exchange sites on the resin. The third is a suppressor column packed with a high-capacity cation exchanger capable of converting the eluent and separated anions to their corresponding acids. Finally, the separated anions, in their acid form, are determined quantitatively by their respective retention times, following detection with an EC cell and comparison with known standards (<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">This chemically-suppressed, IC system has United States Environmental Protection Agency approval for the analysis of Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> in drinking water. The method is also suited to surface waters, and mixed domestic and industrial wastewaters (<a href="#ch05ref14">O&#8217;Dell <em>et al.</em> 1984</a>). The approximate detection limit is 0.1 mg Cl/L, which equates to 0.5 mg Cl/kg of air-dry soil. Refer to Australian Standard AS 3741 (<a href="#ch05ref02">Anon 1990</a>), Section 4110 C of <a href="#ch05ref04">APHA (1998)</a> and Method D 4327&#8211;97 of <a href="#ch05ref06">ASTM (2000)</a> for further details on analysis by IC.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 5.5.</strong> Schematic of a chemically suppressed Ion Chromatographic System.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Set up the IC in accord with manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Specifications typically change over time. Equilibrate by pumping Eluent Solution (usually around 2 mL/min) for &#8776;15&#8211;20 min through all three columns. Allow sufficient time for the system to stabilise, or until a stable baseline is obtained. Adjust the conductivity detector during this period (usually 10&#8211;30 &#956;S). Also zero-out eluent conductivity with the detector offset, and with the fiber or membrane suppressor, adjust the regeneration flow rate, usually to 2.5&#8211;3 mL/min.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine the retention time for each anion by injecting a 2.0 to 3.0 mL aliquot of the Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> Solution for Retention Time (4.0 mg Cl/L). Use a syringe and inject into the sample entry port. If other anions are to be determined, their retention times should also be calibrated at this stage, with solutions containing only the anion of interest. Note the time required for the peak for each anion to appear on the chromatogram and record in minutes. These times will vary from one column to another, and are influenced by eluent flow rates and temperature. With the Eluent Solution described, the order of anions is always F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub>2<sup>&#8211;</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>.

<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_60"></a>Analyse the Reagent Water blank and the High-, Intermediate- and Low-range Calibration Solutions by injecting 2&#8211;3 mL aliquots as previously described. Prepare calibration curves for Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (and all other anions of interest) by plotting peak height (usually &#956;S) or peak area &#8211; from the chromatogram &#8211; against the concentrations of the anion calibration solutions. Note that a single standard calibration is possible if linearity can be established for a known detector setting. In such cases, determine the calibration factor <em>F</em> from peak height or area and the retention time. A calibration curve is preferred, however, for better precision and bias when the relationship is non-linear such as with HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>(<a href="#ch05ref04">APHA 1998</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Next, inject a known volume of the filtered soil/water extract (same volume as used for the calibration solution/s). Record the ion chromatogram, evaluate peak height or peak area as required for comparison with the relevant calibration curve, and determine the anion concentration (Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> in this case), initially as mg anion/L. Multiply by 5 to convert to mg anion species/kg air-dry soil. [Another sample can be injected after the last peak (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>) has appeared and the conductivity signal has returned to base line.] To avoid interference when Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> or other anions present at high concentrations overlap neighbouring species, minimise this by sample dilution with reagent water, and adjust for the dilution used.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When the calibration is known to be linear, the following equation can be used to calculate the anion concentration as follows:</p>

<p class="para">This variant of the ion chromatography technology described in 5A3a shares the same analytical capabilities, advantages and disadvantages over other analytical finishes mentioned in the preamble to that method. Anions in clear aqueous extracts within the mg/L concentration range separate in the order F<sup>&#8211;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, Br<sup>&#8211;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, with individual analyses able to be completed within 30 min using only a few mL of extract. No particles passing through the system should exceed 0.45 &#956;m and best separations occur when sample pH values range between 5 and 9. The approximate detection limit is 0.1 mg/L, with an injection volume of 100 &#956;L, which for Cl in a 1:5 soil/water extract equates to 0.5 mg Cl/kg of air-dry soil.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The application is applicable to the quantitative analysis of F<sup>&#8211;</sup> only if extracts are known to be free (or made to be free) of interference from short-chain organic acids and carbonate. For example, solid-phase extraction cartridges and/or filtering devices that retain organic acids and pass inorganic anions are available to enable F<sup>&#8211;</sup> analysis, typically with a low eluent flow rate. Note that ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> and Br<sup>&#8211;</sup> coelute under the specified conditions.
