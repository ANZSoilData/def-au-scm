<p class="center-para1"><a id="page_ii"></a><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p class="paraa">Most methods in this book involve chemicals, special apparatus, other scientific equipment, and field and laboratory operat&#352;nal procedures that can be hazardous, particularly if used by untrained staff or with unsuitable fac&#213;ities. Moreover, wh&#213;e guidance is often offered, the method descript&#352;ns do not necessar&#213;y address all safety problems and related issues (including responsible disposal of all wastes) associated with their use. It is the responsib&#213;ity of users of these methods to establish in advance appropriate safety and health practices, including any operat&#352;nal limitat&#352;ns faced by particular laboratories and their staff. The same applies to methods undertaken in the field.</p>
