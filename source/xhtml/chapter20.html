<h2 class="h2a">Acid sulfate soils</h2>
<p class="para">Acid sulfate soils (ASS) result from processes that release H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> into the soil &#8216;system&#8217; as the soil ripens. The term also refers to soils in which H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> has been, is being, or will be produced in amounts that have lasting effects on soil behaviour and on adjacent waters. Such soils occur in virtually all climatic zones worldwide, with most located in relative recent coastal marine deposits in sub-tropical and tropical regions (<a href="#ch20ref12">Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). Land use changes for agriculture, urban development, flood mitigation and for roads are often implicated in allowing oxidation to commence and continue, with consequential releases of large quantities of acid and the subsequent mobilisation of potentially toxic levels of Fe, Al, Mn and possibly heavy metals and metalloids such as arsenic (<a href="#ch20ref10">Dent 1992</a>; <a href="#ch20ref21">Powell and Ahern 2000</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Of most significance in eastern Australia are Holocene marine sediments deposited during the last 6000 to 10 000 years, when sea levels were around 1&#8211;1.2 m higher than present. During and following this marine transgression, sea or brackish water with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> flooded sediments containing organic detritus from coastal vegetation such as mangroves, particularly in sub-tropical and tropical environments. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. <em>Desulfovibrio</em> species) flourish under such conditions in the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, breaking down the OM and reducing SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, ultimately to FeS<sub>2</sub>, as outlined in Eqn. 1 and Eqn. 2.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f427-01.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">The overall reaction (<a href="#ch20ref09">Dent 1986</a>) of pyrite formation, assuming Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as the source of Fe, is shown in Eqn. 2. Generally, sediments formed in warmer regions have a higher concentration of sulfides than corresponding sediments of colder regions.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f427-02.jpg" alt="Image"></img></p>
<p class="indent-para">Pyrite is the major form of reduced S in most coastal marine-derived sediments and in ASS but other forms occur, such as marcasite (white iron pyrite, also FeS<sub>2</sub> but with a different structure, symmetry and crystal shapes). In addition, iron monosulfides (FeS; often termed acid volatile substances) commonly form in fresh, bottom sediments and as coatings on pyrite framboids. Monosilfides have the potential to generate acid on oxidation more rapidly than pyrite (<a href="#ch20ref12">Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#ch20ref27">Smith 2004</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Pyrites and monosulfides in farmlands are usually associated with low-lying, water logged soils: e.g. Hydrosols and humic gleys, which are soils that are continually or intermittently moist, with or without a peaty covering, but with dark-coloured organic-mineral horizons of moderate thickness underlain by mineral gley horizons. Provided the pyrite remains covered with water, the material is stable and the pH is often weakly alkaline to slightly acidic. These <a id="page_428"></a>are sometimes termed potential acid sulfate soils (PASS), because of their potential to form H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> following oxidation. In contrast, actual acid sulfate soils (AASS) are very strongly acidic (usually soil pH values &#60;4.0), due to earlier release of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Because oxidising conditions often overlay reducing conditions in the same soil profile, AASS and PASS can apply to different parts of the same profile. The term ASS is used to refer to the whole profile of these kinds of soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Old root channels are influential in ASS. They initially provide a source of organic material, permit the rapid entry of sea water, supplying SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> and rapid removal of bicarbonate-rich waters (Eqns. 1 and 2). Subsequent partial oxidation of pyrite produces jarosite [KFe<sub>3</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>], a pale yellow-coloured mineral often seen in ASS affected areas. The formation of jarosite requires oxidising conditions, the presence of K<sup>+</sup> and a pH &#8804;3.7 (<a href="#ch20ref31">van Breeman 1973</a>). Jarosite has low water solubility (K<sub>sp</sub> = 10<sup>&#8211;98.6</sup>) and obtains its K<sup>+</sup> from acid-weathering products of alumino-silicates and/or from exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> present in the soil. Moreover, other minerals in the alunite&#8211;jarosite group can occur, such as natrojarosite (Na<sup>+</sup> substitutes for K<sup>+</sup>) and hydronium jarosite (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> substitutes for K<sup>+</sup>). Consequently, both pyrite and jarosite are not uniformly distributed through most soil profiles, making representative sampling difficult to achieve. As a broad rule of thumb, ASS in coastal regions are highly unlikely to occur at uncontaminated sites with current-day surface elevations of 3&#8211;10 m above mean sea level (<a href="#ch20ref12">Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). In addition, ASS deposits are unlikely to occur in river systems with freshwater outflows much larger than tidal exchange volumes (<a href="#ch20ref36">White <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Pyrite contained in ASS can range from 0.1% to 18% dry wt, with median values commonly around 1.5%. Agreed &#8216;action levels&#8217; of oxidisable S in Eastern Australia that trigger further management range from 0.03% S in sands, 0.06% in medium-textured soils, and 0.1% S in fine-textured soils (<a href="#ch20ref04">Ahern <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Recognising ASS</em></h3>
<p class="para">In addition to desktop assessment based on topographic and ASS maps, two principal approaches are used to recognise ASS, and to indicate risks and land management options. These are:</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax">&#8226; visible on-site indicators (e.g. iron staining, water colour, vegetation, jarosite), and</p>
<p class="hangindent-parax">&#8226; laboratory and field testing.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Visible on-site indicators</em></p>
<p class="para">Firstly, low pH (i.e. pH &#8804;4) in streams and swamps, inclusive of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup>, can cause natural waters to become milky green (indicating dissolved Fe<sup>2+</sup>) through to bluish green of high clarity (indicating low pH and high dissolved Al concentration). More commonly, natural waters, stream banks and stream sediments can develop rust or ochre coloured stains of Fe oxyhydroxides and oxides. Flocs and &#8216;ropes&#8217; of these may develop in rivers, particularly following major run-off events.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Secondly, substantial corrosion to concrete structures such as culverts and bridge pylons can be expected. The process involves exfoliation and dissolution of concrete structures through formation of etteringite [e.g. (CaO)<sub>3</sub>(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)(CaSO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.32H<sub>2</sub>O], a product resulting from reaction between gypsum and calcium aluminates in concrete.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Thirdly, chronic acidity promotes the dominance of acid-tolerant plants such as water lilies, sedges, marine couch, melaleuca, casuarina and phragmites. Acid tolerant fish are favoured and in extreme cases, fish kills may occur due to Al toxicity, although tissue hypoxia may also be a factor due to chemical oxygen demand (<a href="#ch20ref12">Gardner <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). Acidified drain waters in coastal Eastern Australia have been linked to the prevalence of epizootic ulcerative <a id="page_429"></a>syndrome (red-spot disease), although this fish disease can occur in waters of widely varying pH (<a href="#ch20ref26">Sammut <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Fourthly, when heavy-textured ASS are exposed, trapped H<sub>2</sub>S can be liberated, easily identified immediately from its distinctive &#8216;rotten egg&#8217; smell. H<sub>2</sub>S production is an important stage in pyrite formation and its rate of production from SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> reduction (see Eqn. 1 for example) is always faster than the subsequent reaction transforming it into FeS<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#ch20ref35">White and Melville 1993</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Finally, the presence of yellow, butter-like material, especially around the edges of prior root channels and along drain banks and cuttings, is indicative of jarosite. This mineral commonly forms when PASS material is excavated and allowed to oxidise.</p>
<p class="para1"><em>Laboratory and Field Testing</em></p>
<p class="para">The chemistry of ASS can be complex, and so too can be their analysis. Because of this complexity, there is no universal, low cost, laboratory or field analytical procedure that provides all the information required to effectively characterise ASS and to provide help for their management. Several laboratory tests (e.g. <a href="#ch20ref28">Sullivan <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>; <a href="#ch20ref24">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch20ref05">Ahern <em>et al.</em> 2004c</a>; <a href="#ch20ref07">Anon 2008</a>) and field tests (e.g. <a href="#ch20ref11">Dent and Bowman 1996</a>; <a href="#ch20ref20">Plunkett <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch20ref25">Raymond and Rayment 2003</a>, <a href="#ch20ref34">Watling <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>), however, have been developed in Eastern Australia for characterising and determining potential environmental risks from these soils, plus related attributes such as neutralising value and lime requirements. Details are summarised in <a href="#ch20tab1">Table 20.1</a>, with more information provided in preambles to individual methods.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Choice of method depends upon the reason/s for testing, whether approximate results are all that are necessary, equipment in the laboratory, how quickly a result is required, and the quantum of funds allocated for testing. For example, the field tests included in this chapter are usually cheaper and faster than the more reliable and accurate laboratory alternatives provided. Field testing does enable the rapid testing of multiple sites and profile segments close to when earth-work decisions must be made. Confidence in the field-derived findings improves with local experience and when supported by tests of corresponding ASS attributes in an accredited laboratory.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Laboratory testing is always preferred for precise studies. In addition, all components of the soil&#8217;s acid&#8211;base budget warrant consideration for critical studies on net acidity and liming rates for ASS. Two suites of analysis that take these components into account are the &#8216;chromium suite&#8217; and the &#8216;SPOCAS suite&#8217;, outlined diagrammatically in <a href="#ch20fig1">Figures 20.1</a> and <a href="#ch20fig2">20.2</a> (<a href="#ch20ref03">Ahern <em>et al.</em> 2004b</a>). The complexity of each suite depends on the initial soil pH. Several determinations and calculations may need to be made. It is noteworthy that total S determinations alone (see <a href="chapter10.html#chapter10">Chapter 10</a>) do not equate to the actual or potential acidity of ASS, nor does knowledge of total soil S alone account for acid neutralising reactions in the soil that may decrease or counteract potential acidity due to the oxidation of sulfides.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Moist soils sampled immediately prior to examination (with any free-water discarded) are used for field tests. For all <a href="chapter20.html#chapter20">Chapter 20</a> ASS tests intended for laboratory use, however, it is essential that soil samples reach the laboratory in a manner that limits or prevents atmospheric exposure that could trigger oxidation reactions after sampling. Samples should be dried at 85&#176;C soon after receipt at the laboratory and subsequently ground to &#60;0.5 mm particle size, after removing visible shell, stones and litter. Finer grinding to a powder (e.g. in a ring mill to &#60;75 &#956;m) is recommended by <a href="#ch20ref02">Ahern <em>et al.</em> (2004a)</a> and in Australian Standards (see <a href="#ch20ref07">Anon 2008</a>) for most ASS methods. More recent research, however, suggests this tedious and costly step may not always be warranted (D Lyons, A McElnea, N Finch and C Tallis unpublished report 2009).</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_431"></a><a id="chapter20sec01"></a>20A1 Chromium reducible S (S<sub>CR</sub>)</h3>
<p class="para">The Cr reduction method (S<sub>CR</sub> method) is based on the conversion of reduced inorganic S to H<sub>2</sub>S by a hot acidic CrCl<sub>2</sub> solution; the evolved H<sub>2</sub>S gas is trapped quantitatively in a Zn acetate solution as solid ZnS. The ZnS is then treated with HCl to release H<sub>2</sub>S into solution, which must then be quickly titrated with I<sub>2</sub> solution to the blue-coloured end point indicated by the reaction of I<sub>2</sub> with starch.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This laboratory method is relatively quick. It reliably measures reduced inorganic S compounds in soils and sediments (<a href="#ch20ref30">Sullivan <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). Those measured are: i) pyrite and other Fe disulfides; ii) elemental S, and iii) acid volatile sulfides (e.g. greigite and mackinawite). The method can be made specific to the Fe disulfide fractions if pre-treatments are used to remove the acid volatile sulfides and elemental S fractions. Importantly, safety protocols must be observed at all times as the method uses and produces toxic chemicals: H<sub>2</sub>S is a flammable gas (flash point of &#8211;82&#176;C, explosion limits of 4.3&#8211;46%, and an auto-ignition temperature of 260&#176;C), and Cr is a potential environmental contaminant.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The S<sub>CR</sub> method is not subject to significant interferences from S in either organic form or inorganic form (e.g. gypsum) as can occur with peroxide oxidisable methods (<a href="#ch20ref29">Sullivan <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). It is arguably the most reliable chemical measure of reduced inorganic S and is particularly suited to reduced and organic soils. The method is recommended for very low sulfidic soils as it has good sensitivity and precision around the action limits that trigger the need for the management of ASS in some Australian states. The reporting limit of the method described is around 0.02% S, with the range of 0&#8211;10% S achieved by varying soil sample weights. <a href="#ch20ref28">Sullivan <em>et al.</em> (1999)</a>, using a 5.0% pyrite standard and a slightly different method, had a pyritic recovery of 98.7%. <a href="#ch20ref08">Canfield <em>et al.</em> (1986)</a> recorded 95.9% recovery, while <a href="#ch20ref22">Raiswell <em>et al.</em> (1988)</a> reported &#8216;close to 100%&#8217; recovery using similar Cr reduction methods.</p>

<p class="indent-para">The schematic diagram of the S<sub>CR</sub> distillation unit (<a href="#ch20fig3">Figure 20.3</a>) is not to scale. The condenser, for example, should be a minimum length of 400 mm, ideally connected to a refrigerated cooling-water supply. Glass/glass connections should be ground and gas-tight, with PTFE sealing rings recommended. Moreover, all stages of the procedure, including digestion of soil, distillation of H<sub>2</sub>S and subsequent titration to quantify the amount of H<sub>2</sub>S liberated/absorbed must be conducted in a fume cupboard operating (as a minimum) to AS 2243.8 (<a href="#ch20ref06">Anon 2006</a>), since the method uses and produces toxic chemicals. A sensitive H<sub>2</sub>S gas sensor with detectors adjacent to the apparatus and the Zn Acetate Solution should be installed, tested regularly, and used to monitor the local atmosphere during the conduct of this procedure. The fume cabinet must be operating with sufficient efficiency to prevent operator exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S gas in excess of 10 mg/L and much lower if possible.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When the distillation unit/s are set up and tested for efficient and safe operation, weigh 0.5 g (or as guided by Note 3) of finely ground soil (&#60;0.5 mm, previously dried rapidly at 85&#176;C) into a double-neck round-bottom digestion flask. Record the actual sample weight to nearest 0.001 g (W g). Add, with adequate safety precautions (see Note 2), 2.0 g of Cr powder (a calibrated scoop for the batch of Cr powder on hand provides satisfactory accuracy) and 10 mL 95% Ethanol to the digestion flask and swirl to &#8216;wet&#8217; the sample. Include a reagent blank in each batch and subject it to the same procedure as for soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Place the digestion flask in the heating mantle and connect to the condenser. Attach the pressure equalising funnel, making sure the N<sub>2</sub> gas flow arm is facing the condensers and that <a id="page_436"></a>the solution tap is shut. Attach a Pasteur pipette to the outlet tube at the top of the condenser and insert it into a 100 or 150 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 40 mL of Zn Acetate Solution. Ensure there is a flow of cooling-water flow in the condenser.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Add 60 mL &#8776;6 M HCl to the glass dispenser in the pressure equalising funnel. Connect the N<sub>2</sub> flow to the pressure equalising funnel and adjust the flow to obtain a bubble rate in the Zn Acetate Solution of about 2&#8211;3 bubbles/sec. Allow the N<sub>2</sub> gas to purge the system for about 3 min. Slowly release the &#8776;6 M HCl from the dispenser into the double-neck flask. Wait for 2 min before turning on the heating mantle and adjust the heat so that a gentle boil is achieved. Check for efficient reflux in the condenser. Allow to digest for 20 min. This part of the procedure must be undertaken in a fume hood to protect the operator from any H<sub>2</sub>S gas hazard.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Subsequently, remove the Erlenmeyer flask and wash any of the ZnS formed and adhering to the Pasteur pipette into the Erlenmeyer flask, using deionised water. Add 20 mL of &#8776;6 M HCl and 1.0 mL of the Starch Indicator Solution to the Zn Acetate Solution and gently mix on a magnetic stirrer (or mix by swirling). Titrate the Zn Acetate trapping solution (now containing ZnS) with the I<sub>2</sub> Solution to the first permanent-blue end point. Record the volume of titrant (A mL). Perform the same titration on the blank sample and record the volume of titrant (B mL). As toxic concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S gas can be evolved after HCl is added to the Zn Acetate trapping solution, at least that part of the procedure should be carried out with caution and with a minimum of delay after the HCl has been added.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following completion of the titration and when the solution is cool, discard the residual solutions (these contain Zn, strongly acidic CrCl<sub>3</sub>, plus soil residue), typically via an interim step of safe, bulk storage prior to later commercial disposal of the hazardous waste. Storage container/s and storage location/s must take account of the occasional possibility of further H<sub>2</sub>S release, particularly when residues from soils very high and very low in S<sub>CR</sub> are combined. It is bad practice to knowingly dispose of heavy metals such as Cr and Zn into the municipal sewerage system.</p>

As the metal (non-ionic) and as a fine powder (e.g. &#60;0.5 &#956;m), Cr powder may cause (among others) pneumoconiosis if inhaled across the long term. The fine powder is combustible and gives off irritating or toxic fumes in a fire. Moreover, Cr is a human carcinogen (may cause lung and throat cancer) and a mutagen. (It has an airborne exposure limit of around 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> over 8 h.) Accordingly, a minimum size specification for the Cr powder no finer than 0.5&#8211;1.0 &#956;m is suggested to lessen the chance of operator exposure. In addition: (i) a respirator equipped with a P2 filter should be mandated when handling the Cr powder; (ii) any Cr powder spillages should be removed with a HEPA filter (not a standard shop vacuum cleaner), and (iii) management should consider testing urine Cr levels (these should be &#60;15 &#956;g Cr/L of urine) if any staff over-exposure is suspected.</p>

<p class="para">The improved Suspension Peroxide Oxidation Combined Acidity and Sulfur (SPOCAS) method (<a href="#ch20ref17">McElnea <em>et al.</em> 2002a</a>) supersedes the Peroxide Oxidation Combined Acidity and Sulfur (POCAS) and related methods (e.g. <a href="#ch20ref13">Latham <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>). The SPOCAS method gives better recovery of S than the POCAS method and less potential for jarosite formation (<a href="#ch20ref17">McElnea <em>et al.</em> 2002a</a>; <a href="#ch20ref18">McElnea <em>et al.</em> 2002b</a>).

<p class="indent-para">The SPOCAS acid trail involves direct determination of acidity by titration of the 1 M KCl soil suspension (1:40 ratio), whereas the S trail indirectly predicts acidity by using a combination of S determinations and stoichiometric relationships. Two measures of acidity are carried out, specifically TAA (titratable actual acidity) and TPA (titratable potential acidity). Titratable <a id="page_438"></a>sulfidic acidity (TSA) is the difference between TPA and TAA. All three measures of acidity are conveniently expressed as mol H<sup>+</sup>/tonne. To convert from mol H<sup>+</sup>/tonne to %S, divide by 623.7 (<a href="#ch20ref03">Ahern <em>et al.</em> 2004b</a>), when it is assumed all acidity is from pyrite.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The pH<sub>KCl-ASS</sub> is measured after 4 h extraction with 1 M KCl (followed by overnight standing). TAA is performed on a 1:40 soil/suspension by titration to pH 6.5 (<a href="#ch20ref14">McElnea and Ahern 2004a</a>).</p>

<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Expect the initial addition of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to cause an exothermic reaction, which for soils high in reactive pyrite can be quite violent (see <a href="#ch20fig5">Figure 20.5</a>). The addition of deionised water at the first sign of vigorous reaction will help moderate the situation. Additionally, the reaction may become more vigorous with heating. In such cases, remove the relevant flasks from heat, add a small quantity of deionised water, and return the flask to the hot plate or equivalent when the reaction vigour has subsided. It is important to add water to maintain a volume of 45&#8211;50 mL; occasional washing with deionised water helps dissolve salts that adhere to the sides of the container above the liquid line.</p>

Specifically, when one mole of jarosite containing 2 moles of S is hydrolysed (see Eqn. 4), 3 moles of H<sup>+</sup> are generated, which contrasts with 4 moles from pyrite.

<p class="para">The amount of acidity able to be leached to the environment from ASS may be diminished or even reduced to negligible levels should the soil contain alkaline compounds such as carbonates, soluble silicates and/or hydroxides. Coarse shell material in the soil usually has little effective neutralising capacity <em>in situ</em> due to its small surface area to volume ratio. Accordingly, pre-existing coarse shell material should not be crushed into fine particles during sample preparation for this and similar ASS methods.</p>

<p class="para">This method is based on that of <a href="#ch20ref11">Dent and Bowman (1996)</a>. It is suited to a &#8216;field laboratory&#8217;, requiring only simple equipment and readily available chemicals. <a href="#ch20ref11">Dent and Bowman (1996)</a> saw significant advantages in dealing with soil samples &#8216;immediately&#8217;, as this limited the possibility of drastic changes in the chemistry of actual and potential ASS between sampling and the commencement of critical tests. They also saw difficulties in using results expressed on an oven-dry basis, as highly organic &#8216;unripe&#8217; ASS may contain as much as 90% water. This can make the volumes that ASS actually occupies hard to assess, unless the dry bulk density of the field sample is known accurately.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Dent-Bowman Method has three separate components: viz. total (now termed titratable) actual acidity (TAA<sub>D-B</sub>); total sulfidic acidity (TSA<sub>D-B</sub>); and residual quick neutralising capacity (RQNC<sub>D-B</sub>). The method uses a 10 mL, tightly packed field moist soil sample. The TSA<sub>D-B</sub> test represents the approximate potential acidity that can be released on oxidation and subsequent drainage of the sample material.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_451"></a>Because of the simplicity of the tests and relatively low reagent costs, the operator is encouraged to perform these tests on multiple &#8216;replicate&#8217; samples, mainly to gain an idea of the point-to-point variability of TAA<sub>D-B</sub> and TSA<sub>D-B</sub>, which may be &#177;30% for closely spaced 10 mL samples of apparently uniform material (<a href="#ch20ref11">Dent and Bowman 1996</a>). Knowledge of this variability has practical importance, as treatments to alleviate acid hazards must deal with the highest concentrations of actual and potential acidity as well as the median. Note that laboratory tests typically deal with sub-samples of profile segments, such as 0&#8211;10 cm or 50&#8211;60 cm.</p>

<p class="para">Place into a 200&#8211;250 mL heat-resistant container a 10 mL volume of sample using a clean, modified plastic syringe (see Note 1). Make this into a 100 mL suspension with 1.0 M NaCl, shake across a period of 2 h then leave the suspension to equilibrate for 24 h. Stir again then, after calibrating a pH meter equipped with a glass/reference electrode combination, measure <a id="page_452"></a>the pH of the suspension. If pH is &#8805;5.5, go directly to TSA<sub>D-B</sub> and undertake that determination. If pH is &#60;5.5, titrate with stirring to pH 5.5 with Standard 0.1 M NaOH solution. This titration is best performed using an auto titrator but may be performed manually. Particularly if performing the titration manually, allow the pH around the end point to stabilise for 1 min, plotting a titration curve to beyond pH 5.5, then reading from the curve the volume of titrant (NaOH) used to reach pH 5.5.

<p class="indent-para">Use protective gloves and spectacles and in a ventilated area carefully add 10 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> then transfer the beaker to a water bath set at 50&#8211;60&#176;C, or allow the beaker with contents to stand in sunlight until the sample begins to react (bubble). Do not use excessive heat as this can cause the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to break down and become ineffective. Expect samples high in pyrite and/or related minerals and with elevated levels of OM to froth strongly. Add further 10 mL aliquots of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> until oxidation of the sample is complete, which may take a few hours or days. Up to 200 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may be needed for peaty soils containing pyritic minerals. At this point, record the total volume of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> used. Oxidation is complete when the addition of further H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produces no further reaction, the mineral soil has become light brown or grey, and the supernatant solution is clear/transparent but not murky.

They suggest that the non-plunger be cut off to give a 10 mL volume (with the plunger drawn fully inside the syringe barrel, with the rubber seal removed if it produces too much friction). It helps to bevel outwards the cut-end of the plastic syringe tube. The 10 mL volume needs to be checked periodically for accuracy. When using the modified plastic syringe to sample soil, sediment or mud, press each sample to remove air bubbles and analyse as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Shells and fragments of shell are commonly found in ASS of coastal regions. These shells have neutralising potential but are very slow acting because of their small surface area and coatings of gypsum. For similar reasons, shell can take several days to fully dissolve at pH 5.5. If a measure of the eventual neutralising capacity of coarse shell is required, they may be separated by sieving mechanically and then analysed separately for neutralising capacity.</p>

Now attempt to shear out some of the soil into a ribbon. Behaviour of soil during this shearing action characterises field texture. Specifically, soil with a high sand content has very little coherence and cannot be moulded (<a href="#ch20fig7">Figure 20.7</a>), whereas soil with high clay content can be ribboned out to 75 mm or more (<a href="#ch20fig8">Figure 20.8</a>).
