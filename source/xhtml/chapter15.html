<h2 class="h2a">Ion-exchange properties</h2>
<p class="para">Physical and chemical properties of most soils are influenced by their ion-exchange characteristics, including the amount and balance of individual ions present. Important to soil characterisation are the (normally) divalent exchangeable cations Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>; the monovalent cations Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>; trivalent Al<sup>3+</sup>; and soil cation and anion exchange capacity (CEC and AEC). The last two are measures of a soil&#8217;s ability to retain cations and anions, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soil CEC equates to the product of the specific surface area and surface charge density. Coarse materials such as silica sands and poorly weathered feldspar usually have low CEC (&#60;5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg). In contrast, illite and smectite minerals such as montmorillonite, possess moderate to high specific surface areas and surface charge densities. Thus they have relatively high CECs (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref61">Uehara and Gillman 1981</a>). The clay minerals kaolinite and gibbsite have low to moderate specific surface areas but low densities of surface charge from isomorphous substitution, resulting in negligible CEC from permanent charge surfaces.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Active surface charges also develop due to adsorption of potential-determining ions, particularly H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Where this occurs, the net surface charge (this may be negative, zero, or positive) is determined by the ion that is adsorbed in excess. The colloids involved are termed &#8216;variably charged&#8217; as they are influenced by conditions such as solution pH, ionic strength and the presence or absence of specifically adsorbed ions. Functional groups of OM such as carboxyl and amino, as well as mineral oxides, including sesquioxides [these oxides contain three atoms of oxygen with two atoms (or radicals) of some other substance such as Al] possess variable charge characteristics. These properties of colloids are often found in highly weathered soils, which are common in humid, tropical regions.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Effects of the charge characteristics of clays and other colloids may not be readily apparent to the observer (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref55">Theng 1980</a>). Losses of nutrient cations, however, such as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are greatest when soil CECs are &#60;5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref46">Sanchez 1976</a>). In contrast, leaching losses of these nutrient cations are typically low from soils of medium (15&#8211;25 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg) to high (&#62;25 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg) CECs.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Where strong weathering has caused the decomposition of clay minerals, the resultant soil colloids typically become dominated by soil minerals with both positive and negative surface charges. As these soils (including organic colloids) become more acidic, their ECECs decline, while AEC usually increase (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref55">Theng 1980</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref61">Uehara and Gillman 1981</a>). As P sorption increases, net positive surface charge decreases (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref38">Parfitt 1980</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nutrient anions that would normally leach under humid conditions can be immobilised within the profile of soils with significant AEC, at least until adsorption sites are saturated. Nitrate is weakly adsorbed, while SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&#8211;, in that ascending order, are strongly adsorbed (Parfitt 1980). <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref06">Black and Waring (1979)</a> identified the importance of highly weathered sub-soils in these processes, while <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref16">Gillman and Abel (1987)</a> were able to partition soils in the Tully&#8211;Innisfail area of north Queensland into three groups on the basis of their surface charge characteristics. River alluvium had relatively high CEC at soil pH (the current soil pH), including a relatively high portion of permanent negative charge. Nutrient and other cations show resistance to leaching in such soils, even if soil acidification subsequently occurs. Another group, mainly soils formed from granitic and metamorphic rocks, had both low CECs and low AECs, a situation where both nutrient cations and anions are likely to leach. The third group, derived almost entirely from basaltic rock, had low CECs at soil pH, but also relatively high AECs (1.9&#8211;3.5 cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg), particularly at depth. These soil properties favour the leaching of cations and the retention of anions such as nitrate. If allowed to further acidify, the ECEC of these soils would decline while AECs would increase (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref43">Rayment <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>). <a href="#ch15tab1">Table 15.1</a> provides a general guide to the range of CEC values of clay minerals and organic colloids.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><em>Measurements</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soil ion-exchange properties are usually assessed by replacing or exchanging the ion or ions in question with an index ion of similar electrical charge or sign. For example, cations such as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, lithium (Li<sup>+</sup>), and silver thiourea (AgTU) have been used for extraction of exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, and for estimating CEC. Copper thiourea is reported to be a cheaper yet effective alternative extractant to AgTU for the determination of basic cations in soils (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref32">Little 1989</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Factors that affect the results reported for exchangeable cations and CEC include size of the index cation, its affinity for particular ions and exchange sites, the associated anion, ionic strength, the soil and solution pH, soil/solution ratio, and time of contact between the soil and solution. Many of these can alter surface charge characteristics of variable-charge colloids during the soil extraction process.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The presence of soluble or potentially soluble salts of the basic cations, including common salt (NaCl), gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O), limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and dolomite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>/MgCO<sub>3</sub>), can also lead to errors in estimation of exchangeable bases and ECEC. Some methods physically remove these interfering components, usually by pre-treatment with a solvent such as aqueous ethanol or aqueous glycerol (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref58">Tucker 1985</a>). Alternatively, soluble salts may be measured directly and subtracted from an estimate of soluble plus exchangeable bases. They may be ignored when insignificant quantities are present or when only approximate estimates of soil exchange properties are required for soil fertility assessment.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref52">So <em>et al</em>. (2006)</a>, working with two soils from south-east Queensland and extraction with 0.1 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, concluded that when soil solution ionic strength exceeded 50 mM <a id="page_293"></a>or around 4 dS/m, correction for soluble salts was best done by calculation rather than by prior solvent removal of soil solution cations. This was because prewashing increased measured exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations while simultaneously decreasing the measured exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Methods described herein for extraction of basic exchangeable cations employ ammonium chloride (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 7), ammonium acetate (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7), barium chloride/ammonium chloride (0.1 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl), alcoholic 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 8.5, and AgTU. Most can be expected to extract similar amounts of Ca, Mg, Na and K from non-calcareous and non-saline soils (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref18">Gillman <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>). Smaller amounts of Ca and Mg are extracted, especially from oxide-rich soils, by alcoholic 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 8.5, an extractant formulated for use on calcareous and sodic soils.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The preferred method for the acidic cations (H<sup>+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup>) required for the calculation of ECEC and Al saturation, employs molar potassium chloride (1 M KCl). Exchange acidity of soil at pH 8.2 is determined by extraction with BaCl<sub>2</sub>/triethanolamine. Soil CEC at pH 8.2 (the sum of the exchangeable basic cations plus BaCl<sub>2</sub>/triethanolamine exchange acidity) is a component of a criterion in Soil Taxonomy for separating Alfisols and Ultisols. <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref50">Searle and Lee (1984)</a> reported that AgTU was as effective as 1 M KCl at removing Al from a New Zealand soil.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch15tab2">Table 15.2</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter, which includes and adds to the methods described by Rayment and Higginson (1992). Four chemical procedures for direct estimates of soil CEC are included. Further information on each method category is provided under a series of sub-headings. Refer to <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref23">Hislop and Hornbeck (2002)</a> for guidance on coping with high-salt concentrations in extract solutions during analysis by ICPAES.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Sampling and Sample Preparation</em></h3>
<p class="para">Soil samples for ion exchange determinations, in common with most other soil chemical tests, are typically air dried (40&#8211;45&#176;C max.), ground or sieved to a particle size of &#60;2 mm, prior to analysis and subsequent storage. Unlike some soil fertility tests, however, sampling often involves a sequence of depths throughout the soil profile.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Based on a review by <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref12">Etchevers (1986)</a>, there is evidence that air drying can increase soil surface acidity slightly, due to the polarisation of residual water by cations adsorbed to clay surfaces. This enhanced acidity can, in turn, increase the solubility of organic material to a limited extent. Small increases in extractable Al (assumed to be Al<sup>3+</sup>) have been reported, but this effect is usually ignored because of the analytical convenience of air drying.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The apparent levels of soil K may also be affected by soil drying, sometimes liberating more K and other times fixing soil K (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref12">Etchevers 1986</a>). In addition, the season of the year can affect the amount of Al (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref24">Hun 1971</a>) and K (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref04">Bieske 1968</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref01">Anon 1983</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref12">Etchevers 1986</a>) extracted by laboratory tests. <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref04">Bieske (1968)</a> reported the changes in Queensland soils used for sugar cane involved a fairly regular rise and fall in available K<sup>+</sup> throughout the year. Increases occurred from winter through to the hot, early summer, followed by a subsequent decrease with the advent of summer rains, irrespective of whether the land was cropped or fallowed. Such effects can be minimised by specifying a preferred time for soil sampling, which for sugar cane in coastal Queensland is May to October (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref04">Bieske 1968</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter15sec01"></a>15A1 Exchangeable bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg2+, Na+, K+) &#8211; 1 M ammonium chloride at pH 7.0, no pre-treatment for soluble salts</h3>
<p class="para">This method enables the reasonably speedy extraction/determination of the exchangeable bases in soil. It is used mainly in assessments of soil fertility and as part of the determination of ECEC. There is no pre-treatment to remove soluble salts or suppression of carbonate dissolution. Consequently, it is not usually recommended for saline, calcareous or gypsiferous soils. Modifications of this method are available when overestimates due to the presence of soluble salts are expected; see Methods 15A2 and 15A3.</p>

<p class="para">This method is suitable for direct measurement of cation exchange capacity (CEC) on soils known to be dominated by minerals with permanent surface charge. In addition, it gives estimates of exchangeable bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) similar to those obtained by method 15A1.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Nowadays, the method is not used widely, but it provides a link to historical data on the ion exchange properties of Australian soils (e.g. <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref54">Stace <em>et al.</em> 1968</a>). It is appropriate for the measurement of basic exchangeable cations from non-calcareous, non-gypsiferous, near neutral soils that are low in soluble salts [EC (1:5, soil/water) &#60;0.3 dS/m].</p>
<p class="indent-para">Extraction of exchangeable bases is achieved by initially shaking the soil for 1 h with aqueous 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 7.0 at a soil/solution ratio of 1:10. The suspension is then filtered and the soil washed with additional Extracting Solution giving a final soil/solution ratio of 1:20. Exchangeable bases are determined in the combined extract.</p>
<p class="indent-para">CEC is determined after leaching soil in the filter funnel with a solution of 15% potassium nitrate/6% calcium nitrate to displace exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. According to <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref59">Tucker and Beattie (1974a)</a>, the KNO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O solution should displace the residual Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> completely in addition to removing &#62;99% of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> from soils of high exchange capacity.</p>

This includes calcareous soils from the central west of New South Wales (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref40">Pierce and Morris 2004</a>). It will also provide reliable estimates on soils dominated by colloids with permanent negative surface charges.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method is known to underestimate exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and simultaneously overestimate apparent CEC of neutral and acidic soils that contain variable-charge colloids (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref18">Gillman <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref03">Baker 1984</a>). By virtue of its high ionic strength and strong buffering capacity, however, it does provide a measure of maximum negative charge that can be developed by soils containing variable-charge colloids.</p>

<p class="para">As indicated in a note associated with <a href="#ch15tab5">Table 15.5</a>, ICPAES may experience difficulties due to the presence of alcohol in the extracting solution presented for analysis. If ICPAES analysis is possible, set up and operate the ICPAES instrument as advised by the manufacturer. Suitable wavelengths are: Ca = 430.25 nm; Mg = 285.21 nm; Na = 588.96 nm; and K = 766.49 nm. Calibrate the instrument using an appropriate range of Working Standard Solutions, guided by examples in <a href="#ch15tab5">Tables 15.5</a> and <a href="#ch15tab6">15.6</a>. The 1:40 soil/extraction ratio can be factored into the calibration on the ICPAES. A calibration blank should also be measured and adjustments made as necessary.</p>

Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are measured on diluted extracts, whereas, extracts for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> analysis are only diluted if over range. A calibration blank should also be measured and adjustments made as necessary.</p>

<p class="para">Method 6B4 contains an outline and several references on the use of this emerging analytical technology. In brief, it relies on statistical relationships between MIR spectra and results obtained from conventional soil test measurements.</p>
<p class="indent-para">There is good evidence (e.g. <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref26">Janik and Skjemstad 1995</a>; <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref25">Janik <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>) that different absorption bands exist in the MIR region, which permit the non-destructive estimation of many soil components. These include exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and CEC, corresponding to results obtained following extraction with alcoholic 1 M ammonium chloride at pH 8.5 (Method 15C1). Unfortunately, present findings (D Lyons, pers. comm.) are that MIR is unable to reliably estimate exchangeable Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations equivalent to those from Method 15C1. Soil samples should be &#8776;40&#176;C air-dry and finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm). Sequential scans typically take around 1&#8211;2 min/sample.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Stabilise and verify the set up and operating performance of the MIR spectrometer, usually incorporating an auto-focussing diffuse reflectance accessory or capability. Also confirm the &#8216;standard calibration&#8217; for this method, which should provide results that correlate strongly with results obtained by Method 15C1 on similar soil types.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Load the instrument&#8217;s auto-sampler with &#8216;unknown soils&#8217;, previously dried to &#8776;40&#176;C and finely ground (&#60;0.5 mm) to assist with sample uniformity. Typically, the instrument or its associated computer will integrate the spectral signals with the calibration equations to provide the result without further calculation, if the conventional method&#8217;s results were expressed on an oven-dry basis (preferred).</p>
<p class="indent-para">If the calibration equations were based on conventional measurements expressed on an air-dry basis (&#8776;40&#176;C), then the MIR results will need to be adjusted for residual moisture using relevant air-dry moisture to oven-dry moisture ratios, guided by Method 2A1.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter15sec09"></a>15D1 Exchangeable bases and CEC &#8211; 1 M ammonium acetate at pH 7.0, pre-treatment for soluble salts, manual leach</h3>
<p class="para">Ammonium acetate (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7) is in wide use internationally for extraction of exchangeable bases (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) from soils. Some reasons are given by <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref47">Schollenberger and Simon (1945)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This extractant has had less use in Australia for two principal reasons. Firstly, 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc can dissolve solid phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in erroneously high values for exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>. <a id="page_314"></a>Secondly, it is difficult to confirm the complete removal of excess NH<sub>4</sub>OAc prior to re-leaching soil for the measurement of CEC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method plays an important role in Soil Taxonomy (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref53">Soil Survey Staff 1975</a>). It should provide similar estimates for exchangeable bases and CEC to method 15B2 on non-calcareous, non-gypsiferous, near neutral soils known to be dominated by clay minerals with permanent surface charges.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following removal of most soluble salts, exchangeable bases are leached from the soil with 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7.0 at a soil/extractant ratio of 1:46, subsequently diluted to 1:50. After removal of excess NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, the soil plus acid-washed sand mixture is releached with 1 M NaCl, again to a final soil/extractant ratio of 1:50. This second leachate is retained for direct measurement of CEC.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The method is similar to that described by <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref07">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1987)</a>, except different reagents are used to remove soluble salts. If &#177;0.6&#8211;0.7% gypsum is known to be present, direct measurement of gypsum and other soluble salts is recommended, followed by appropriate adjustments to exchangeable bases and CEC.</p>

<p class="para">Mix 5.00 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) with 10.0 g acid-washed sand and pack the soil sample into a leaching tube (<a href="#ch15fig4">Figure 15.4</a>) containing a plug of freshly macerated filter paper. Concurrently, carry a blank containing 10 g of sand through with the assays.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Remove most soluble salts by leaching with 50 mL of 60% Aqueous Ethanol, followed by 2 mL of 20% Aqueous Glycerol. Allow to drain and discard leachates. Leach the sample/sand, mix with 230 mL 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7.0 into a 250 mL volumetric flask. Make to 250 mL with leaching solution (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7.0). Leaching should take at least 4 h to avoid low results from incomplete extraction. To avoid channels and air locks during leaching, apply a gentle suction to the outlet of the leaching tube when the 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc is added. Retain the leachate for determination of exchangeable bases.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 15.5.</strong> Arrangement of syringes and reservoir used with the Concept Engineering, Inc automatic extractor.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Syringes are 60 mL capacity, made from polypropylene. Use one sample tube, reservoir tube and tared extraction syringe for each sample (<a href="#ch15fig5">Figure 15.5</a>). Rubber or plastic tubing is used to connect syringe barrels. As the sample syringes and reservoirs are not held securely in the extractor, they are prone to dislodgement and must be handled with care. Before use, wash each component that contacts the sample or sample extract initially with water, then with &#8776;1 M HNO<sub>3</sub>, followed by 3 rinses with deionised water in order to limit contamination.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Maintain a separate set of reservoirs and receiving syringes for use with NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, Aqueous Ethanol, and NaCl. If kept separately, the reservoirs need only be rinsed with deionised water after each use. Moreover, receiving syringes used for Aqueous Ethanol and Aqueous Glycerol Wash Solutions require rinsing only, as their contents are discarded.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The barrel and plunger used to draw reagents through the sample syringe will deteriorate quickly if the plunger head is not kept lubricated with silicone lubricant. In addition, inadequate lubrication causes surges of suction as the plunger grips the walls of the barrel and then suddenly releases.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><strong><em>Procedure</em></strong></h3>
<p class="para">Prepare extraction tubes by placing a Whatman No. 2 filter paper (sized to the internal diameter of the leaching tube) at the bottom of the leaching tube. Fix the filter paper in position using an inert rubber O-ring, also sized to the internal diameter of the leaching tube. Locate these in position using a syringe plunger without its seal.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_320"></a>Weigh 2.50 g of air-dry soil (&#60;2 mm) and either 2 g &#8216;celite&#8217; or 5 g acid-washed sand into a clean dry container and mix thoroughly. Transfer the sample into a sample barrel (tared if preferred) using a powder funnel to avoid the sample contacting upper walls of the syringe barrel. Wind the upper two discs of extractor down to the starting position and place leaching tubes in upper disc. To each tube, connect an inverted syringe with its silicone-lubricated plunger inserted in the slot of the stationary disc of the extractor.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Rinse the sides of the sample tube with 60% Aqueous Ethanol &#8211; using a wash bottle &#8211; and fill to the 25 mL graduation mark with the same reagent. Tap the tube to re-level the sample and to remove any entrained air. Place a reservoir on top of the sample tube, start extractor, and extract at a setting of 1 until the Aqueous Ethanol is at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 cm above the sample. Turn off the extractor and add another 25 mL Aqueous Ethanol. Again operate extractor at a setting such that all Aqueous Ethanol is leached through the sample in about 1 h. In a similar manner, leach the soil/sand with 25 mL 20% Aqueous Glycerol and discard the leachates.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following removal of soluble salts, return extractor discs to their starting position. Fill the leaching tube to the 25 mL graduation with 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7.0 Extracting Solution and let stand for 15 min. Tap to relevel the soil/sand and remove any air bubbles.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Replace reservoir on top of sample tube, start extractor and extract at a setting of 1 until the 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7 Extracting Solution is at a depth of 0.5&#8211;1.0 cm above soil/sand. Turn off extractor, add 45 mL of 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc to the reservoir, and extract soil/sand overnight at a setting of 10.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The following morning, switch off extractor and pull the plungers down as far as the extractor will allow. Disconnect receiving syringe from sample tube (leaving rubber connector on sample tube). If tared receiving syringes were used, weigh syringes containing the 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc extract to nearest 0.01 g then retain a portion for determination of exchangeable bases. Alternatively, transfer the NH<sub>4</sub>OAc extracts to flasks calibrated at 125 mL, make to volume with 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc at pH 7 Extracting Solution and mix thoroughly. Retain for determination of exchangeable bases.</p>
<p class="indent-para">To remove excess 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, return extractor discs to their starting position. Carefully and thoroughly wash inside walls of the leaching tubes with 60% Aqueous Ethanol from a wash bottle, until the liquid reaches the 25 mL graduation mark above the soil/sand. Stir and tap the leaching tube containing the soil/sand and Aqueous Ethanol to dislodge air and let stand for 15&#8211;20 min. Reconnect the reservoirs and receiving syringes used for Aqueous Ethanol and Aqueous Glycerol to the leaching tube and extract at a setting of 1 until level of liquid is 0.5&#8211;1.0 cm above the soil/sand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Turn off extractor, add approximately 45 mL of 60% Aqueous Ethanol to each reservoir, and then re-power and extract at a setting to ensure 45&#8211;90 min of leaching.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When this Aqueous Ethanol extraction is complete, remove inverted syringes and discard the ethanol leachate. Remove reservoirs, wind upper two discs down to starting position and reattach the ethanol syringes. Again, fill the sample tubes to the 25 mL mark with 60% Aqueous Ethanol and replace reservoirs. Repeat the Aqueous Ethanol extraction but omit stirring of samples. When extraction is complete, pull plungers of inverted syringes down as far as possible, remove, and discard contents.</p>
<p class="indent-para">If using direct distillation to determine CEC by Method 15I1, no further leaching of soil is required. For automated colorimetric determination of CEC (15I2) or if using the formol titration (Method 15I4), continue leaching as follows.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Remove Aqueous Ethanol reservoirs and return upper two discs to starting position. Attach a clean set of inverted syringes and fill sample tubes to 25 mL with 1 M NaCl. Place a clean set of reservoirs on sample tubes and extract at a setting of 1 until NaCl is at a depth of 0.5&#8211;1.0 cm above sample. Turn off extractor, add 45 mL of 1 M NaCl to reservoir. Extract sample overnight <a id="page_321"></a>at a setting of 10. Next morning, switch off extractor and pull plungers down as far as possible. Disconnect syringes containing NaCl leachate and transfer contents to 100 mL volumetric flasks. Make to volume with 1 M NaCl and mix thoroughly. Alternatively, if tared syringes were used, the amount of leachate can be determined by weight (nearest 0.01 g).</p>

<p class="para">The original compulsive exchange method of <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref17">Gillman and Bakker (1979)</a>, later described by <a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref45">Rhoades (1982)</a>, for use on highly weathered tropical soils, has been superseded (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref19">Gillman and Sumpter, 1986</a>). It was found (<a href="chapter15a.html#ch15ref18">Gillman <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>) that barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) alone yielded low results for exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> when compared to extracting solutions containing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The revised method, suited to the same soils, employs 0.1 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for the initial extraction of exchangeable bases; this concentration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is sufficient to overcome the before-mentioned limitation at the same soil/solution ratios.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Following removal of entrained NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> with 0.05 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>, the ionic strength of BaCl<sub>2</sub> solution in the presence of soil is adjusted, usually to 0.006 M.

To avoid loss of material, which may occur in pouring, remove supernatant solution by suction (e.g. a vacuum water pump).</p>
<p class="indent-para">To reduce the ionic strength to 0.006 M (the approximate strength of many soil solutions across Australasia) wash the soil 3 times with 20 mL portions of 0.002 M BaCl<sub>2</sub>. After addition of the third portion, mix thoroughly and record suspension pH<sub>BaCl2</sub> to obtain an estimate of soil pH at the ionic strength of a non-saline soil.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Centrifuge, remove the supernatant solution and, if an estimate of AEC is required, retain it for analysis of non-adsorbed (entrained) Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> (C<sub>2</sub>). If not required for AEC, discard the supernatant solution. Weigh the centrifuge tube (y) to estimate the volume of BaCl<sub>2</sub> retained in the soil, if measuring AEC.</p>

<p class="indent-para">Begin the compulsive exchange of Ba<sup>2+</sup> by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, by adding 10 mL of 0.005 M MgSO<sub>4</sub> solution. Mix thoroughly and allow to stand for 1 h. End-over-end shaking of the tubes from this point onwards is not recommended unless leakage can be prevented.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Compare the EC of the suspension with that of 0.0015 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>. If the conductivity ratio (CR; conductivity of suspension/conductivity of 0.0015 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>) is &#60;1.0, add 0.5 mL increments of 0.05 M MgSO<sub>4</sub> until CR &#62;1.5, allowing a little time for a steady state to be reached between additions. If no addition of 0.05 M MgSO<sub>4</sub> is necessary, i.e. CR &#62;1.0, take no further action. A conductivity meter that will accept a reference electrode and which will operate in &#8216;ratio mode&#8217; is preferred for these measurements, although a conventional conductivity meter fitted with a single electrode will suffice.</p>
<p class="indent-para">It is important that the soil is saturated with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and this does not always occur if the CR is gradually brought up to 1.0, with addition of the weaker 0.005 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Check the pH of the suspensions. In some oxidic soils, addition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8211;</sup> results in an increase of pH. If pH is greater than pH<sup>BaCl2</sup> by more than 0.3 units, reduce the suspension pH to pH<sup>BaCl2</sup> by dropwise addition of dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Use 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for this purpose for well-buffered soils; for less well buffered to weakly buffered soils, 0.05 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 0.01 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, respectively, are recommended. With highly buffered soils such as the Ferrosols, it is usually safe to initially adjust pH to &#60; pH<sup>BaCl2</sup>, knowing that an upwards pH drift will occur.</p>

<p class="indent-para">After samples have stood for at least 1 h, reduce the CR to about 1.0 by adding deionised water, and allow to stand overnight. The assessment of how close to approach CR = 1 is dependent on soil type.

<p class="indent-para">Recheck CR and adjust to 1.0 &#177; 0.05 with deionised water. The addition of H<sup>+</sup> causes a reduction of negative charge on variable charge surfaces and hence the release of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and a rise in CR.</p>
