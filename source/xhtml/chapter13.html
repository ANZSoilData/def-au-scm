<h2 class="h2a">Extractable iron, aluminium and silicon</h2>
<p class="para">Iron, Al and Si are common elements in the earth&#8217;s crust and in soils. Among the most abundant non-clay minerals found in the clay fractions of soils are the oxides and hydroxyoxides of Fe (hematite, maghemite, goethite, lepidocrocite), Al hydroxides and oxy-hydroxides (gibbsite, boehmite), Si oxides (quartz, opaline silica), and some disordered forms of Si (<a href="#ch13ref19">Norrish and Pickering 1983</a>). <a href="#ch13ref27">Ure and Berrow (1982)</a> report typical total concentrations in soils of 0.01&#8211;21% Fe, 0.07&#8211;20.3% Al, and 50&#8211;70% SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soil minerals dominated by these elements can be grouped into: (a) those that are easily weathered; (b) those that are moderately resistant to weathering, and (c) those that resist weathering (<a href="#ch13ref27">Ure and Berrow 1982</a>). The first three chemical tests in this chapter help characterise different forms of Fe, Al and Si that affect soil properties. The extractants are acid ammonium oxalate (<a href="#ch13ref24">Tamm 1922</a>; <a href="#ch13ref16">McKeague and Day 1966)</a>, sodium pyrophosphate (<a href="#ch13ref03">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1981</a>; <a href="#ch13ref04">1987</a>), and citrate-dithionite (<a href="#ch13ref12">Holmgren 1967</a>). For example, the ratio of oxalate-extractable Fe to dithionite-soluble Fe quantifies the proportions of the more and less active fractions, and has been shown to be a useful parameter for characterising soil properties such as P sorption (<a href="#ch13ref23">Schwertmann and Taylor 1989</a>). Sequential extraction of soil involving all three methods in the order pyrophosphate/acid ammonium oxalate/dithionite can be used as a further aid to the type and distribution of Fe in the sample (<a href="#ch13ref26">Taylor 1987</a>). Examples of the levels of Tamm&#8217;s Oxalate-extractable Fe, Al and Si in New Zealand reference soils are summarised in <a href="#ch13tab1">Table 13.1</a>, derived from data published by <a href="#ch13ref29">Vortman (1980)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The fourth method for extractable Si (13D) is used to assess the likely responsiveness of crops such as sugar cane and rice to applications of silicated products such as Ca silicate, basalt rock dust, diatomaceous earth, and sugarmill muds (<a href="#ch13ref10">Haysom and Chapman 1975</a>; <a href="#ch13ref11">Haysom and Kingston 1999</a>; Berthelsen <em>et al.</em> 2001). The method is based on extraction with 0.005 M sulfuric acid, which is the same extractant used for soil P by Method 9G. The test is correlated with relative sugar cane yields as assessed by field experimentation in Queensland (<a href="#ch13ref02">Kingston 1999</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a href="#ch13tab2">Table 13.2</a> has summary details on the methods included in this chapter for measuring Fe, Al and Si. Methods 13A1 to 13C1, inclusive, were similarly coded in <a href="#ch13ref22">Rayment and Higginson (1992)</a>. More details on all methods are provided in method preambles. No analytical performance data derived from soil interlaboratory proficiency programs of ASPAC are available for these tests.</p>

<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_255"></a>There is a long-held view (<a href="#ch13ref25">Tamm 1932</a>) that the reactivity of acid oxalate on crystalline oxides and crystalline clay minerals is very limited. There are, however, exceptions. For example, the extractant can remove crystalline Fe oxides if a source of Fe<sup>2+</sup> is present, as occurs with siderite and maghemite (<a href="#ch13ref23">Schwertmann and Taylor 1989</a>; <a href="#ch13ref26">Taylor 1987</a>). This can result in overestimates of Fe associated with poorly crystalline soil minerals. The reagent will also dissolve some Al oxides present in soils. Relations between &#8216;Tamm&#8217; Fe and Al have been demonstrated by <a href="#ch13ref18">Metson and Cox (1978)</a>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The reagent has little effect on the clay minerals kaolinite, montmorillonite, vermiculite or illite but it does react with biotite and chlorite, which are both trioctahedral-layer silicates. It should only be used on calcareous soils if there is prior removal of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (see Note 1). <a href="#ch13ref15">Loeppert and Inskeep (1996)</a> report that extracts of acid ammonium oxalate will include water-soluble Fe, exchangeable Fe, and part of the organically-bound Fe. As an empirical chemical test, the method is influenced by reaction time, temperature, and the vigour of shaking.</p>
<p class="indent-para">To avoid possible changes due to photo-reduction of Fe-containing soil minerals, extraction with acid oxalate must occur in the dark (<a href="#ch13ref23">Schwertmann and Taylor 1989</a>). The method, which employs an initial soil/extract ratio of 1:100, is similar to those described by <a href="#ch13ref03">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> (1981</a>, <a href="#ch13ref04">1987</a>). Above 5% acid oxalate-extractable Fe or Al, the soil/extract ratio should be increased to 1:200, as demonstrated by <a href="#ch13ref20">Parfitt (1989)</a>.</p>

Check and adjust pH to 3.0&#177;0.05 with either chemical. This reagent corresponds approximately to 0.114 M ammonium oxalate and 0.086 M oxalic acid, giving a total oxalate concentration of 0.2 M.</p>

<p class="indent-para"><em>Aluminium</em>. Dissolve 1.000 g pure aluminium wire in 20 mL hydrochloric acid (HCl; 10 M) with the addition of a trace of mercury salt (one small crystal of mercuric chloride; HgCl<sub>2</sub>) to catalyse the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><em>Iron</em>. Initially clean about 1.5 to 2.0 g pure iron wire in 10 M HCl, wash with deionised water and dry quickly. Weigh 1.000 g of the iron wire, after cutting into small pieces, and dissolve in 40 mL 5.0 M HCl, heating on a water bath if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><em>Silicon</em>. Finely grind pure silica sand (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and dry to constant weight at 450&#176;C. Cool, and weigh 2.139 g into a platinum crucible. Add 12.0 g sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). Heat over a burner or in a muffle furnace until molten and continue heating at 1000&#176;C for 30 min.

For a 1:100 soil/solution ratio and a 1+4 dilution of sample extracts only, soil concentrations are 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75 and 5.0% of Fe, Al and Si, respectively.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Shake 1.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;0.5 mm) with 100 mL Acid Oxalate Reagent in 250 mL bottles in the dark on an end-over-end shaker for 4 h at 25&#176;C. Following extraction, continue to avoid exposure to light for as long as the soil and Acid Oxalate Extractant remain in contact. Centrifuge to obtain &#8776;50 mL of extract, which should be clear when viewed using reflected light. Following separation of extract and soil, there is no short-term need to store extracts in the dark prior to instrumental analysis.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For expected soil concentrations of Fe in the range 0&#8211;5%, dilute sample extracts only 1+4 using the 1+4 CsCl diluent solution. If higher concentrations are expected, re-extract fresh soil using a soil/solution ratio of 1:200 prior to 1+4 dilution of sample extracts only with the 1+4 CsCl diluent solution.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine Al, Fe and Si in standards, blank and diluted extracts by ICPAES. Alternatively, determine Al and Fe in standards, blank and diluted extracts by AAS or by FES, the latter two using a lean nitrous oxide-acetylene flame, which should have a &#8216;red feather&#8217; zone 1&#8211;2 cm high. For Si by AAS, a moderately rich nitrous oxide-acetylene flame is preferred.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Determine concentrations of individual elements in mg/L from separate calibration curves (or regression equations) and apply a blank correction. If any delay in instrumental analysis is expected, the clarified extracts should be kept cool and stored in the dark to prevent photo-induced decomposition of oxalate, as this may result in loss of Fe by precipitation (<a href="#ch13ref07">Borggaard 1988</a>). See Note 2 re the concentration of oxalate.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_257"></a><em>Notes</em></h3>
<p class="hangindent-para">1.&#160;&#160;Calcareous soils should be pretreated to remove any CaCO<sub>3</sub>, since oxalic acid will react with solid-phase CaCO<sub>3</sub>, thus affecting the pH of the oxalate/oxalic acid buffer. Also, oxalate precipitation as the insoluble Cs salt can be expected. The preferred pre-treatment involves use of ammonium acetate at pH 5.5 (<a href="#ch13ref15">Loeppert and Inskeep 1996</a>).</p>
<p class="hangindent-para">2.&#160;&#160;Avoid high concentrations of oxalate during instrumental analysis (particularly by AAS) as oxalate can cause clogging of the burner head. To minimise this possibility, dilution (known volume) with deionised water to the extent possible is recommended by <a href="#ch13ref15">Loeppert and Inskeep (1996)</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter13sec02"></a>13B1 Pyrophosphate-extractable Fe and Al</h3>
<p class="para">Values for pyrophosphate-extractable Fe are used in some soil classification systems to identify podzolised soils. The pyrophosphate reagent will remove Fe-organic complexes and Al-organic complexes (<a href="#ch13ref26">Taylor 1987</a>) by acting as a dispersing agent. Organic matter containing Fe and Al is peptised along with Fe minerals of high surface area and appropriate surface chemistry, such as ferrihydrite (<a href="#ch13ref21">Parfitt and Childs 1988</a>), but more importantly geothite (T.A. Beech, pers. comm.; <a href="#ch13ref17">McKeague <em>et al.</em> 1971</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">When performing this analysis, especially on soils that contain large quantities of very fine, poorly crystalline materials, failure to obtain suitably clear extracts can cause analytical difficulties. Erroneously high values by flame spectrometry can be avoided by &#8216;clearing&#8217; soil extracts before analysis using high speed centrifugation (20 000 rev/min), usually in conjunction with added &#8216;Superfloc&#8217; (<a href="#ch13ref02">Ballantyne <em>et al.</em> 1980</a>; <a href="#ch13ref04">Blakemore <em>et al.</em> 1987</a>). When pyrophosphate-extractable C is required to confirm the presence of a spodic horizon in Soil Taxonomy (Method 6C1), however, &#8216;Superfloc 127&#8217; should not be included prior to centrifugation.</p>

<p class="para">Dispense 0, 2.5, 5.0, 12.5, 25.0, 37.5 and 50.0 mL combined Fe and Al Primary Standard into 500 mL volumetric flasks. To each add 50 mL 22% Sodium Citrate solution and 1.0 g Sodium Dithionite, mix well, and make to volume with deionised water. These solutions contain 0&#8211;100 mg/L of Fe, Al (and Si). For a 1:50 soil/solution ratio, a subsequent addition of 50 mL water to sample extracts only, and a further 1+9 dilution of the sample extracts only, soil concentrations are 0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10% Fe and Al (and Si), respectively.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_259"></a><em>Procedure</em></h3>
<p class="para">Shake 1.0 g air-dry soil (&#60;0.5 mm) with 50 mL 22% Sodium Citrate and 1.0 g Sodium Dithionite on an end-over-end shaker continuously for 16 h at 25&#176;C. Accurately add 50 mL deionised water containing 5 drops of Superfloc solution, shake vigorously for 5 sec, and centrifuge or filter to obtain extracts free of fine soil particles. Dilute these already diluted extracts 1+9 with deionised water and leave loosely stoppered in a cool place for at least 2 days. Include a reagent blank throughout.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Using undiluted working standards and clear soil extracts (diluted as above), read values of Fe and Al by ICPAES (preferred) or by AAS, and determine concentrations in mg/L of Fe and Al from separate calibration curves (or regression equations). Significant background interference is likely with FES. Apply a method (blank) correction.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><em>Calculation of results</em></h3>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="chapter13sec04"></a>13D Acid-extractable soil silicon</h3>
<p class="para">Silicic acid is a general name for a family of chemical compounds with the general formula [SiO<sub>x</sub>(OH)<sub>4-2x</sub>]<sub>n</sub>. Simple silicic acids that occur in very dilute aqueous solution include metasilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>), orthosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), disilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and pyrosilicic acid (H<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>). A source is the acidification of Si salts such as sodium silicate in aqueous solution. In the oceans, soluble Si exists primarily as orthosilicic acid (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), while the most common aqueous forms of Si are H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> (<a href="#ch13ref28">van Dokkum <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Silicon is beneficial rather than essential for higher plants. Beneficial effects are reported to include lessening the P fixing capacity of soils, easing Al and Mn toxicity, promoting root growth, and perhaps contributing to disease resistance. Around 25&#8211;30% of the cropping soils of coastal Queensland (mainly cane fields) are rated as marginal to deficient in soluble Si, while Si is being continuously depleted from the root zone by crop removal, by soil loss, and in runoff water (e.g. <a href="#ch13ref06">Berthelsen <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">Several empirical methods have been used with variable success to assess &#8216;plant-available&#8217; Si. These include demineralised water, 0.5 M acetic acid, 1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0), 0.5 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.8), 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, 0.5 M citric acid, Mehlich 3, 0.01 M calcium chloride (<a href="#ch13ref05">Barbosa-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>; <a href="#ch13ref06">Berthelsen <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>; <a href="#ch13ref09">de Lima Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="#ch13ref30">Wang <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>) and 0.005 M sulfuric acid (<a href="#ch13ref11">Haysom and Kingston 1999</a>). The last two mentioned of these (0.01 M calcium chloride and 0.005 M sulfuric acid) plus unbuffered (pH 2.5) and buffered (pH 4.8) 0.5 M acetic acid have been examined against the responsiveness of sugar cane to Si in Queensland (<a href="#ch13ref11">Haysom and Kingston 1999</a>).</p>
<p class="indent-para">The extraction procedure described provides an estimate of soluble Si plus the capacity of soils to supply Si (<a href="#ch13ref06">Berthelsen <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). According to <a href="#ch13ref14">Kingston (1999)</a>, who reported a strong correlation between Si from the 0.005 M sulfuric acid test and second-ratoon yields of sugar <a id="page_260"></a>cane, the &#8216;critical range&#8217; separating responsive from non-responsive sites was from 89&#8211;120 mg Si/kg. The test is used routinely in Queensland for Si and involves air-dry soil and overnight equilibration with 0.005 M sulfuric acid at 22&#8211;25&#176;C. Method 13D1 employs a silicomolybdous colorimetric finish (e.g. <a href="#ch13ref01">ASTM 2008</a>). A convenient alternative with an ICPAES analytical finish is coded as Method 13D2.</p>

<p class="para">This method uses the same extracting solution (0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), soil/solution ratio (1:200) and extraction time (16 h) as Method 9G of <a href="#ch13ref13">Kerr and von Stieglitz (1938)</a>. Soluble Si in the clarified extract is determined by a blue silicomolybdous colorimetric finish based on <a href="#ch13ref31">Weaver <em>et al.</em> (1968)</a>.</p>

<p class="indent-para">The colorimetric &#8216;finish&#8217; can be undertaken by continuous SFA (see <a href="#ch13fig1">Figure 13.1</a>) or by FIA.</p>
<p class="indent-para">It is important to assemble the colorimetric manifold in accord with the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. This could require changes to the flow diagram provided for this method.

An appropriate range of Si Working Standards should be analysed (wavelength of 660 nm) at commencement and at regular intervals, using 0.005 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> Extracting Solution as the reagent blank and for the probe wash. Determine Si concentrations from a calibration curve (or regression equation).</p>
